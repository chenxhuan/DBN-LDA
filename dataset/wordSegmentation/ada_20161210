0	Hello    There is so much more you can do besides just carb counting   Make sure each meal has a balance of protein  vegetables and grains  for example quinoa)  Are you eating three meals and snacking in between   How much fruit are you eating   Fruit is good  but it is also sugar and too much can affect your blood sugars    Stress can also affect your blood sugars   How are you coping with the excitement  anticipation etc of  your new arrival     Does your doctor have someone who can work with you on a regular basis to really look at your diet and make recommendations   Sometimes we think we are eating healthy but with the help of someone knowledgeable in healthy eating  nutrition can really make a difference    Good luck and hang in there    donna

0	hugs   It s manageable before I was T  I had GD when I was pregnant with my son five years ago   I think the docs suspected something when my ultrasounds were showing that he was   weeks ahead on his growth   I saw the nutritionist two days later and just watched the numbers when I tested   If it hurts  it s only for an instant   It gets less painful the more you test yourself    After the doctor gave me some tips  I just learned quickly what foods to avoid and what foods to eat  followed my diet plan  and my son came out a normal   pds    oz  The only bugaboo during the pregnancy was having to take insulin at night because my morning numbers were higher than he wanted them  but once I learned how to do it it wasn t a big deal  either    My mother is diabetic  so I was probably a little more prepared for the possibility when I got the phone call from my doctor s office  my reaction wasn t so much devastation as much as  Crap   Okay  tell me what to do )   But you ll get through this   hugs  Dx    -- T  A c    Had GD when pregnant with son When life give you lemons squash the living     out of them

2	Hi Reyna  and welcome to the board  Now I am going to turn   soon and would like to start a family  For that i know i have to have my BG in tight reign so I am trying to take control  Though like most of you were before  I am still deathly afraid of going to the doctor and getting a stern talking to so I am trying take control before I go and make an appt for July     months away ) I know I should have been taking my pills but it wasnt until now that I know i have to go to the doctor to go get them  You come across as being a young woman with a purpose as well as a determination to get your diabetes under control  I am betting that your doctor will recognize this and be happy to be a partner in helping you reach your goals  It certainly is going to be helpful for you to have the meds that you need before July  If one of those pills is metformin you will likely find that it is an aid in losing weight  You can certainly ask your doctor about it  And  by the way  you will not be the first non-compliant diabetic your doc has seen We have a whole bunch of people who are posting on a Weight Loss Challenge thread  You will find lots of support there and of course just generally ask questions of us re controlling your blood sugar  Ask your doctor to send you to a Certified Diabetes Educator  It may be a refresher course for you but it can also reinforce good lifestyle choices  Also there is a good website called diabeticmommy com and you may find others there who are hoping to become pregnant  Hope to hear from you often  Dianne Dianne Diagnosed as type   in   with an A c of   Started with metformin and a low dose of an ARB for blood pressure  Added a sulfonylurea  a med that helps my pancreas produce my own insulin) Also a low dose of Crestor to lower my cholesterol  After   years I could no longer tolerate metformin so am doing my best to keep control with a max dose of the sulfonylurea and lots of walking  some swimming
0	Not trying to sound unsympathetic but for now its GD  Just tink of the health of your baby  Have you gone on a diet ever  If so think of this as a really important diet  Ok rant off but think of this GD allows you to eat really bad  from a non-D view)  Eat lots of eggs meat nuts  get the daddy to buy you steak dinners just skip the mash potatoes  if your meter says bad)  Are you testing  Just saying and I hear about the hormone thing but if you are lucky you can eat for GD for a few months for a healthy baby and maybe you will not have to deal with again  fyi leep an eye since many say GD can indicate higher likelihod of T  down the road  Take care of yourself and your baby  If you need to eat the ice cream after he she is born  pickles are fine eat them with abandon

0	First breathe  I am   weeks with my second child and had have gd with both  Yes you are at increased risk and so are your children  My mom had gd when she was pregnant with me which is the biggest  but probably not only) reason I got it  Protect your daughter by eating right and testing  Don t be scared if you have to use insulin  Most women don t but I had to at night with both pregnancies  I bawled the first time because I felt like I had failed my child but it has nothing to do with that  You cannot and do not control getting gd bug you can control how it will proceed  My son was  lb oz  I had him   days early gained about  lbs  on top of my overweightness) and did not get diagnosed until I was about as far along as you  So you can still have a perfectly healthy baby  Not having more chilfren is a little drastic  I mean I have family history of heart problems  diabetes  asthma  liver disease and cancer  I can pass any of that on or I could pass on something I don t even know about yet  Visit the t  board and you will see diabetes is not the end of your life  It is dangerous but education and commitment can keep it under control  As for your situation now  have you met with a diatician  What are you eating when your sugar is high  Some foods have delayed effects  Are you exercising at all  Keeping a food journal will help you figure out what you can eat  Keep in mind you resistance will grow stronger as you progress so you will need to keep adjusting  I like to eat the same foods for the most part since  although it can get a little boring  it helps me with tighter control  It s only a few weeks after all and I ve done worse diets for stupider reasons how you eat can also impact your sugar  Fat and protein slow carbs and many people can tolerate carbs differently at different times of the day  Let me know if I can help you at all and stop beating yourself up  Easier said than done but I used my previous diagnosis to be more prepared this time around  Good luck  Gestational diabetes Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz

0	I know it is frustrating and upsetting to go through this  There is a powerful stigma about diabetes in all forms that causes people to believe they have brought it upon themselves but you can no more give yourself diabetes than you can cancer or any chronic illness  Gestational diabetes is caused by a hormone from the placenta  Since every baby has its own placenta  you can have gd with one pregnancy and not with another  Although things like your weight or having large babies can increase your risk  they do not cause gd  Say it with me - this is not my fault  Okay  Understand that the test is not wrong  Your number got higher because insulin resistance increases dramaticlly between   and   weeks  A person with normal blood sugar will not get that high no matter what they eat  Ask your doctor if you can skip the three hour and just proceed as if diagnosed  Get a meter a start testing  Depending on your tolerance  you may need to change your diet a little or a lot or you may need insulin  Cross that bridge when you come to it  Also ask to see a dietician who can help you build a personalized meal plan  Diabetes is more about learning how to eat than what you eat  Pairing moderate amounts ofcarbs with fats and proteins will help with spikes and certain types of foods may have more or less of an effect on you  For general advice or ideas with food or testing try posting on the new members or t  boards as the principles are the same  You can probably still make one meal but just eat less of the carbs and more veggies and protein  Your doctor cannot force you to anything but don t think of this as a bad thing  You are being given an opportunity to protect your child  I had gd with both my boys   years and   months)   I took insulin at night to control my fasting sugar  the needles are surprisingly not painful) and both boys were born healthy and weighed  lb  oz and  lb even  I was so upset when it happened with my first but it was really not a big deal at all  Your doctor will most likely want to see you more often esp if you do need insulin  I went twice a week  once for doctors visit and nst and once for ultrasound  If you need insulin and the needles really freak you out you can also ask about glyburide which is a pill  I didn t like it much but it is an alternative if you need it  Most mama s don t need medication though so hopefully you will be one of those  I hope this helps you a little  Good luck and congratulations  Georgina Gestational diabetes Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz

1	and while you are on this honeymoon ride  a lower carb diet will probably make life a bit easier for you  You re recommending a low-carb diet to someone who takes only   unit of insulin for every   grams of carbohydrates he eats  So  exactly how is he supposed to accommodate this  if he eats Bernstein-like  and eats only  g carbs per day  For the sake of easier calculations  let s make it  g carbs per day  split over   meals per day  That s   grams of carbs PER MEAL  which means a mere   units of  log per meal  Tell me  where can you get a syringe that allows you to calculate a dose that small  because I certainly would like a syringe that accurate  Hate to come off as so harsh  but seriously  folks  Not every diabetes ill can be ameliorated by eating food plans that were used prior to the discovery of insulin  Angela

0	Hello lisa Being diagnosed with gestational diabetes is very scary at first  I was devestated the first time I was diagnosed  However  if you are educated about gd  and  trust me  many obs are not well educated about gd so you are already a step ahead by being here) it does not have to be a bad thing  I had gd with both my boys and will almost certainly have it again if I get pregnant again  I learned a lot about food and my body and both my boys and myself came through the experience healthier because of gd  Type two and gd are very similar and the type two boards are much busier so you will probably get more response to any questions there  but feel free to ask your questions where ever you feel comfortable and you will be answered  Good luck with your appointment tomorrow  Gestational diabetes Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz

0	So this is my  rd go round with GD so I should be an expert but things are different this time  I was diagnosed at   weeks  failed by over   points ) My sugars are fine  even fasting now) except for my first meal of the day  I have tried lots of different things like   an english muffin with peanut butter  which was fine the other   pregnancies) but i got a    and even tried a protein bar today that was supposedly only   net carbs and my sugar was   I hate eggs and threw up from sausage so that s out  Any thoughts or ideas would be appreciated
0	I had the routine screening for GD about a month ago   I came back borderline at    cut off at  )   Rather than send me for a   hour test  the doc did a repeat   hour test   This time my levels came back at    much lower and no where near borderline) on the second   hour test   For some reason  they are telling me I have Gestational Diabetes and sending me to counseling and telling me I ll need monitor my blood sugars  etc    I don t understand how the   level on a one hour test flags me for GD without ever doing a three hour test   It doesn t make sense   Honestly  I think somebody entered the lab work wrong and they are reading the result incorrectly as a three hour test   Has anyone ever been diagnosed with GD without going on to a three hour test   What kind of levels generally prompt a diagnosis of GD   I want them to straighten this out because it s adding stress and worry without a clear definition of what limits my blood sugar have surpassed   Also  I already have a very healthy diet  was very active and at a healthy weight when I got pregnant  and have only gained   pounds at   weeks   I just don t understand

0	I was recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes on   and had my diabetes counseling session on    So  its been over   weeks for me modifying my diet  exercising and using the glucometer   At first  I was upset that I had to do the finger-pricking  x a day  I cried during my diabetes counseling session)  but I ve gotten used to it and the diet modification and exercise has really helped me tremendously   I no longer have back pain  can pick up toys off the floor better  have   year old twins at home) and I have maintained or actually lost up to   lbs   I m at   weeks and have gained   lbs I was on my way to gaining   no doubt  before this diagnosis   I was angry at myself when I found out b c part of me thinks my candy and carb eating life style and lack of exercise contributed towards this   I know this isn t the case  but am hoping that I can continue eating more healthy after I deliver and will continue to be a positive influence on my husband and kids   I haven t hit a wall yet  but I bet that in a couple weeks I ll start to get annoyed with the diabetes I miss the sweets a little bit and sometimes find it hard to fit in the   minutes of exercising each day   I don t want to develop Type II diabetes later in life and will do everything I can to prevent this from happening   I can t imagine this being part of my every day life forever

2	Hi  Sheila   As others have said    pounds in   months is good progress   You didn t put all that weight on in one year  you shouldn t expect to take it all off in one year    -  pounds per week is reasonable  you will have to find a rate that works for you   I would not suggest going below   calories per day   I lost a lot of weight by logging everything that I ate  all meals and snacks) in an app that would track my calories for each day so I could see where I stood for the day   I would log everything I ate before I ate it  see what number of calories for the day that took me to  and then decide whether to really eat what I had just logged or to erase it and log something lower in calories   I targeted  -  calories for breakfast   -  calories for lunch    calories for dinner  and around   calories for snacks in my   calories per day   I averaged   pounds per week weight loss with that calorie level  what someone else would achieve depends on activity level and their goal weight   I averaged more weight loss at first  and it gradually slowed as I got closer to my goal weight  George Diagnosed T    A C   Metformin   mg    x daily since   A C     A C     A C     Weight at diagnosis     Weight

1	Thanx for posting the vid  Molly - I watched it   And  in fairness  I think Dr  Phil s comment about the diabetes aspect of this was right on point  diabetes is a chronic disease  NOT a disability   He made that point twice  and left it at that   Since this episode had almost nothing to do with D - except for the fact the parents are worried that that complication is too threatening for them to let their son go off on his own - I don t know that I d expect to hear any more about D from Dr  Phil  except to add the point out that the kid has T  and that that is a totally different disease than the T  that most people  as in  ) think of when they hear diabetes   But ultimately  this show is about a dysfunctional young man who has issues with drugs and alcohol  and happens to be T  as well   So  I guess I sharpened my KABAR and loaded the the   for nothing      w  Wayne T  May   MDI   u Lantus Basal
2	Try Googling Ageusia or Loss of Taste if you haven t and see if you can find something relevant there in the links that come up  This is not something that is related to diabetes but is something else  I heard an interview with someone on NPR a year or so back with someone who had experienced a complete loss of taste and gradually got it back over a period of a year  and had written a very compelling account of it  Well  at least the interview was compelling  but I can t say who it was  Just in the past few weeks  another book was published by the chef at Alinea  a Chicago Restaurant named the best in the US a couple of years ago  who had developed cancer of the tongue  which doctors wanted to remove  He refused and found an alternative chemo treatment  but was told to install a feeding tube  and refused that as well  as a result losing  -  lbs while he underwent treatment  weight that was not extra  As a top chef who could no longer eat or taste anything  it makes for a pretty interesting story  told early on here  and more recently on Fresh Air  though obviously quite different from yours  Morris Diagnosed Type   with an A c of   in    averaging a   A c since then with diet  exercise and Glipizide XL   meds for blood pressure and cholesterol   A bit dated  but scroll down on this page if you want to know more

1	Hi there  I went on the pump   years ago  after   years of diabetes  At first I resisted  now I love it   can t think of doing it any other way   It is an adjustment and it can be a bumpy start   The best part is the flexibility you gain in your eating and activity - it is so nice to not have to stop  what you are doing bc you have to eat at a certain time   The only downside I see is that it is very expensive without insurance   I have only used Medtronic   they have terrific customer service  which is very important   Good luck in your decision

1	Hi all    I am a  -year-old type   diabetic and was diagnosed when I was   my freshman year of college  It was a struggle because it was my first semester of college  in a different state from my family where I knew no one  I was really on top of my diabetes when I was first diagnosed- OCD if you will- but recently I just got the worst A c I ve ever had  )  including the one I got after my diagnosis  I exercise regularly  eat healthy  and on an insulin pump  but lately I ve been struggling keeping my blood sugars under control  It s really hard to be a diabetic in college  and I m just looking for some words of wisdom on how to get through this  it gets me really down sometimes  What should I do  Anyone else out there with type   diabetes in college  How do you handle the stressors of college while balancing diabetes    Thank you  Lane

1	Hey  my name is Paul and I just finished my first year with type   and I m still frustrated  I feel like I cannot control my health  I make almost all my own food and eat very well  I also carb count very well But I seem to go back and forth all the time between control and out of control  When my health is good i am extremely sensitive to insulin and have a carb ration of  u g of carbs and can barely walk longer than   minutes at a time without going low  Then when my health is not good  i can t seem to get my numbers down for weeks at a time  Does anyone else experience this
2	This sounds like me  although my numbers are usually not to high  I was just started on Novolin   units twice a day now  and sometimes my appetite is so poor that I end up skipping meals  and so this leads me to not take my insulin injections of novolog  I am concerned about your numbers though  and I would speak with your doctor about being put on something else for more control of your numbers  It seems the more Novolin I take the more water I want to drink  Again  I would talk again with your doctor about your numbers  Best of luck and wishing you well    Julie Gestational Diabetes -There are many things in life that can defeat us  but YOU MUST NOT be defeated-
1	Hi  I am new to board and am writing for my husband  My immediate question today is this morning before he left for work  his BGL was    a little high  normally his are elevated in am)  About  am  it more than doubled to  no food  He is on a pump  I am learning the lingo  so I apologize for my ignorance in advance  I asked him to try to eat a fruit or something with fiber in the morning tomorrow  test before eating and then again at  ish and see what happens  I don t know if that was the right response  you would think that if he ingests  carbs tomorrow from a fruit  he will have to take some insulin right  so that would automatically lower his BGL but I have no idea  I wonder if his lack of eating is causing a rise in sugar  I also heard today on NPR that women and men metabolize sugar differently  there was lots of talk of Glycemic Index  If you have any sources or articles on that  I appreciate your posts  Thanks

2	Morrisolder      Up until your post  we were not discussing the issue of what is the PRIMARY CAUSE of nutrient deficiencies in the American public today      The issue under discussion was whether or not soil depletion is adding to the problem of nutrient deficiencies in the American public today      I honestly don t know -- or even care -- whether our reliance on processed foods  or our reliance on produce grown on depleted soils  or whether government subsidies to growers of lesser healthier crops  corn  beans  rice  and wheat instead of lettuce  cabbage  kale  broccoli and tomatoes) is the PRIMARY CAUSE of the widespread nutrient deficiencies seen in the American public today      The fact is that they ALL contribute to the problem        So  other than your suggestion that processed foods is the main  primary) cause of the problem  I personally feel all three factors listed above are equally important)  I agree with much of what you have said      But since most Americans -- including alot of diabetics who spend most of their grocery dollars in the produce section of the supermarket -- are still coming up short when it comes to eating enough nutrients  the fact still remains that almost all Americans would benefit alot if they were to take a HIGH QUALITY multi-vitamin each day      The question is    What constitutes a HIGH QUALITY multi-vitamin      Most multi-vitamins are chemical concoctions  and the way they are formulated  they do not free anywhere near as much vitamins and minerals to your body in a usable form as the label suggests they do    The label tells you how much of that particular vitamin is contained within the tablet or capsule    It does NOT tell you how much of that vitamin will be released after it gets inside your body  IN A FORM THAT YOUR BODY CAN UTILIZE      Personally  I do not use any form of chemical multi-vitamin      Instead  I use vitamins that go under the commercial  label of Garden of Life    They are actually made from dehydrated  whole foods  pulverized into powder form  and then stuffed into clear capsules        They make multi-vitamins formulated for the different ages  and genders    So they have a special formula for kids  one for younger males  one for younger females  one for males   and Wiser  and one for females   and Wiser    I take the latter formulation  while my husband takes the male   and Wiser version     I m  )      They are as expensive as all getout  amazon sells them  and a month s supply is like   or so -- and that is just for one person)      But they are  by far  the best when it comes to how well our bodies are able to utilize the product    In fact  there is a BIG difference in how well the body absorbs vitamins that are derived from whole foods as opposed to how they utilize chemical based vitamin products      Which is why I pay the extra money  and buy the whole food based vitamins      As for a link to the   study  there might be one on the net    I am really not sure    I found the journal article when I was doing research in the University of Memphis library  and photocopied the entire article on the spot    And I just give copies of the abstract out when I teach my organic gardening classes      Normally I d be able to dig up the copy and post the reference on the net for you within a day or so  but I m about to under go radiation treatment for cancer and so I had to pack up alot of the stuff I don t need right now and send it off to storage so that my house would be less cluttered  before I begin treatment    When I finish my radiation  I will probably be starting six months of chemo  so I REALLY needed my house de-cluttered and cleaned before I went into all of that      What I remember for certain is that it was in the main scholarly journal for professional dietician academics  in the Dec   issue  and that the primary researcher came out of the University of Texas at Austin      Sorry I can t be of greater help  but right now  my mind is on radiation  not organic vegetable growing
1	audreydaney  wrote  I just started my insulin pump on Monday and I have changed it   times my question is does the pump affect your eating habits  the reason I m asking is because when I changed my site on Wednesday I didn t have an appetite which caused me to have lows partically half the day  I still don t have to much of an appetite  it comes and goes)  I am getting my appetite back slowly but not to the fullest  yesterday I only ate breakfast and when I checked my BG it was around   and I m wondering how can it be high if all I was doing is drinking water  I bought some Boost Glucose Control to drink to replace what I was getting from not eating  does the pump affect your eating habits  I am on the Animas Pump using Novolog with my machine please help if you can  thank you in advance      Congratulations on starting your pump   I know in another thread you were worried about doing the math  but I don t recall if you ever said that you were carb counting or if you had received training on how to carb count  and figure out insulin carb ratios    One of the benefits of the pump   or well controlled MDI with accurate basals) is that you don t HAVE to eat   So once your basal rates are set right  you shouldn t  be having lows if you choose not to eat  But then when you do eat  including something like  Boost)  you need to bolus insulin for the carbs   It s not clear to me if your   is due to the Boost  or your basal rates not being set right    I hope you are working closely with your pump team as you start this new phase of your diabetes management  to get the rates and ratios set Pam Diagnosed Type   at age   months  over   years now Minimed pump and cgm since July   Metformin  insulin resistance)  levothyroxine thyroid)  losartan  BP) I have traveled cross country  and to Canada  UK  Kenya  Mexico  Jamaica  Equador Galapagos islands  and lived in Egypt for a year

0	Sachi    I agree medicine at times may be the best option  but I feel strongly that women should be made aware of other options too   Many seek out support forums like this because our doctors are unable to spend the time with us   Not all doctors have a regular nutritionist on staff  either to sit down with each person and look at their unique and indivual needs      I would hate for someone to start medication because they really did not try everything not because they were not motivated  but because they were never provided the best nutritional support   I spent years trying to lower my cholesterol and manage my blood sugars on my own I swore to my doctor I was eating healthy but I  was not having much success  and my doctor wanted to put me on meds   since my dad had bad side effects I was afraid to start meds so  after finally FORMALLY  studying nutrition   I FINALLY figured out the culprit for me --high fructose corn syrup   They were in my energy bars  energy drinks etc       My only hope here is to raise awareness  help  others to be aware of  ALL options   and hopefully get the proper nutritional support right away     Donna

2	Wow Joshua  I would go crazy in about   days on your meal plan  You have a chronic disease and need to eat  differently  for the rest of your life  It s important you learn to like a much bigger variety of foods to keep your BG at good levels and not fall of the wagon all the time due to boredom with the same ol  food  Try some plain yogurt  NOT fat free) with chopped nuts and maybe a few blueberries  Just check the carbs - Greek yogurt seems to be the best for me  Sometimes I ll have some celery and carrot sticks with Laughing Cow cheese wedges as a spread  Weekends I often make waffles or pancakes using Carbquik  very low-carb version of Bisquik without all the nasty additives) which you can order online at netrition com  Just add some SF syrup and or berries  some sausage etc  for a fabulous breakfast  Cheers  Xena Dx   - A C   Current A C

1	acidrock   ) Just to update this saga  the flexfix tape worked really well although junior commented  it s just like waxing  when I was peeling it off  The monitor seems to be working very nicely too  The caveat being that it s not always the same as the bg but the trend is very visible and it s very handy to have available  If its beeing going down and says   w  an arrow  I am pretty confident that I be feeling the buzz b c I am in the  s already  I have not quite reached the point where I want to not test at all but I can see that I won t need to test  x before big runs and stuff like that as much  I need to go for a long run today but am juggling it w  laundry and an eye on the weather radar and it s handy to have the stream of data for that too  Glad the tape is working well for you  It is the best one out there and I have tried them all  It works well with the Dex too  I am finding the Dex is actually catching Melissa s lows faster and more accurately on the Dex than the Navigator and follows the highs better too  We have had quite a few of both the last few days and are starting to learn to trust this thing  Most times with Navigator it was spot on when she was in a good range  but when she drifted it seemed not to be able to keep up  I have seen numbers in the  s with Dex that I never saw on the Navigator  Like you  when I saw a   or   it was likely   or   It is very odd that the Dex is reading just every   minutes  yet it is more accurate in these ranges  In any case  I will take it  Now to get rid of the rest of that cake to prevent the highs and to make some changes to her insulin doses to get rid of the lows  It is constant around here  One more thing  the first sensor fell off in the shower within   hours  The others stayed on really well with just alcohol  but I used Skin Prep this time  The trainer had it on her list and I had some  so thought that I would try it  Now I recall why I stopped using it  The pods fell off with it too  I called and they said no problem  that they would replace it  About an hour later I saw that I already had a Fed Ex notice  That was so easy compared to talking with the Abbott people  They want all of the info even if you are just calling for batteries  Mary  mom to Michael and Melissa  both Type   Michael is an adult  living on his own and using a CGM and MDI Melissa is also an adult  with an intellectual disability  therefore she needs lots of help managing her diabetes  She uses an Omnipod pump and Dexcom CGM
2	Not too many here are fans of prepackaged meal plans like the shakes you are drinking but if  your numbers are in the normal range  that is a very good sign  Unless you intend to drink shakes for   meals for the rest of your life  however  at some point you will go back to eating more conventional meals  If those meals match the nutritional profile of the shakes they replace  then your glucose numbers likely would stay the same  In particular the grams of carbs would have the most direct effect on you glucose numbers  So if it is the same as those shakes  probably you will be just fine  Losing weight in and of itself means that your cells have less fat  and cells with less fat are less resistant to insulin  So you may have a little leeway there  but you will have to be watching carbs from now on to maintain those normal numbers  Which actually isn t that hard--you will need to count carbs  measure portion sizes and find meals that you can cook easily and like to eat  There are so many foods that work that you should be able to figure it out  If you went to the shakes primarily for weight loss  perhaps that won t be hard   If you did it because you don t know how to cook or can t stand doing it  then you will have to learn  A good place to start will be the Eating Right Discussion group right here on this website  Morris Diagnosed Type   with an A c of   in    averaging a   A c since then with diet  exercise and Glipizide XL   meds for blood pressure and cholesterol   A bit dated  but scroll down on this page if you want to know more

0	Thank you for the response  And you are right in your medicine advice  I have always looked at having to go on medicine as almost failing like I haven t tried hard enough but I guess sometimes no matter what you do you need medicine  I guess since I controlled the other   times on diet only I thought I could this time as well       So I could still be having a problem from overnight even though my fasting sugar is in the  s  I had no idea about that  I m just trying everything I can to be healthy for this baby and everything you read scares you to death  I ve read that since I got it so early on that there can be heart or brain defects and also that since I tested at   for my   hour glucose test that I probably have type   diabetes which obviously is not good news for me

2	HH--   I certainly didn t mean to put you on the spot asking for the link to that study  but was hoping that I could learn more about the changes over time  In the meantime I can try Google  and you can concentrate on more immediate priorities    As for the multi-vitamins  I was implying  as you note  that usually the nutrients in them are not as well absorbed as they are in our body   There are companies out there  including the one you mention  that talk about bio-availability and  as you note  there is a big price differential between those brands and your standard multi-vitamins   I suspect most people choose based on price  however  so that most people who rely on those cheaper vitamins are not getting the nutritive supplementation they think they are paying for    Good luck with your treatment  Morris Diagnosed Type   with an A c of   in    averaging a   A c since then with diet  exercise and Glipizide XL   meds for blood pressure and cholesterol   A bit dated  but scroll down on this page if you want to know more

2	Although health insurance companies wil use anything to justify denial of coverage or increase of fees  the latest complaint about the new legislation is that it will require companies to cover things like screening for diabetes and not allow them to say that the things needed for diabetes care are not covered  Those of you who have been around for a while will remember that the ADA had to fight for many years to get diabetes testing  meds and insulin covered by all health care plans  state by individual state  and that there are still   states where these are not required to be part of any plan  I m not sure of the time line  but the new plan makes it mandatory that these be covered by all plans in all   states  Opponents of health care reform are always quick to say that Canadians come to the US for our superior medical care  but somehow forget the thousands of Americans who fly to India and other countries for routine operations that they either cannot get or cannot afford here at home  And the Canadians who post on this message board express great satisfaction with what they have and would not trade their medical care for what we have to put up with  Morris Diagnosed Type   with an A c of   in    averaging a   A c since then with diet  exercise and Glipizide XL   meds for blood pressure and cholesterol   A bit dated  but scroll down on this page if you want to know more

1	Oh  I do think that reading and music and all of it is importaint  However  I do NOT think you can teach young kids effectively without running them around and keeping them physically active as well  Especially little boys  What s the drugging rate now on kids    in    Higher  When I was in school it was rare for anyone to be on  maintenance medication  other than insulin or even rarer  epilepsy meds  But I don t know ANYONE who was on ritalin or other ADD ADHD meds when I was a kid  They tried to put me on psych meds  but even that got shot down by my parents  We just didn t medicate kids into submission  Instead parents and educators sent them outside to run around until they could think straight  I have nothing at all against teaching all the stuff they need to learn  but do not see the point in making it nearly impossible in the first place  Because if you basically strap these kids to seats and don t get them out  then they re just not going to learn  Their brains aren t made that way yet and even adults  especially males  have a hard time with   or   hours straight desk time  I know I couldn t do it  I have to get up and move around and do stuff or I can t focus  Now a   year old or a   year old  Not going to happen  Any more than you can take a stalled horse and expect him to listen on a brisk Fall morning after being locked in a box   hours a day  And a little walk a few times a day isn t going to cut it  It s a physiology thing  Young animals do NOT pay any attention when they re all interested in going outside and playing  If you strap them down and drug them into submission  their brains still aren t engaged  You re not going to get them to learn in that condition  You might get them to be quiet  but they aren t thinking about what you want them to  They re off in never never land chasing butterflies  But  educators  have forgotten this basic fact of biology in favor of all these silly modern theories  Maybe   minutes of  brisk walking  a day for a pre-teen  What s that  A fart in a hurricaine  Just about  And then  when they  grow up  they don t have the habits or even the health to be truly active  like your neighbor s kid  Because most critters  humans included  don t really develop a whole lot of cells once they become adults  So if you keep a critter in a box  like for example calves for veal  even if you let them out  they never develop normally  This is what we are doing to our kids  Yes  I totally agree with you though that NCLB is the worst thing to come down the pike for destroying any access to education by the middle and lower classes ever invented  Only people who can afford to send their kids to private schools  at least in urban areas  can get their kids educated now  And it s not just my opinion  Ever hear of a gentleman named Dr  Robert Chamberlain  He was a friend of the family and he also said the worst change to education was the inability for schools to get rid of students  THAT was the reason for the destruction of public education  in his quite well educated opinion  But yes  I think that music and reading and particularly comprehension are all very importaint  However  I don t think you can effectively teach those subjects to kids who are strapped to chairs and never  allowed  more than a few minutes of very mild activity a day  Andy

1	KayCee - I m glad you ve started to settle into  the routine   But I m curious about your comment on doing your first injection   When I was diagnosed  they made me give myself my own injections in hospital before they sent me home  of course  I was just a kid and it was a long  long time ago   in a galaxy far  far away  but that s another issue )   Just for your amusement  the nurse in charge of getting me to learn and do my own injection had me give her an injection first  just to get used to the idea   To this day  she was the bravest person I ve ever met    Another note based on a comment in your post   When you refer to being in the honeymoon phase of your diagnosis  please be aware that that term refers to a specific period of time after diagnosis during which a T s pancreas successfully produces insulin again  and insulin is either no longer needed to be injected  or is at severely reduced dosages due to the re-start of indigenous insulin   I suspect you are not using that expression in that manner  but if you are  let us know   There are specific management techniques to be considered for this phase    Meanwhile  Good Luck  with the new  normal    w  Wayne T  May   MDI   u Lantus Basal

1	Poated I can wake up at   not eat anything for a few hours  and find myself in the  s by  AM  Then I can chase that high with   or   or   units of insulin and still not have it back down by lunchtime  I can wake up at   eat breakfast and take a shot of   units of fast acting  and be at   at  AM and be good all through the way till lunch  Tim  Tim - the   A M  high is due to the liver kicking in  its automatic  the brain needs energy as well as the rest of the body and when no food to help then the liver does it for us and usually over-does it  as well  Why would you not eat  Even   grams of carbs should help with a small amount of fast acting insulin  I also believe that more than   to   units to adjust a high BG might be too much  I learned this a few years ago when I had too many highs  the nurse practitioner said less insulin will help that plus   she also told me that the higher the BG the longer it takes for the BG to come down and pumping more insulin into the system does not help  could hinder the lowering  Then too there are certain foods that cause the higher BG levels and that changes for me also - after a few months I need to alter some of my carbs or even avoid some of them for awhile if I have a BG issue  Fine tuning is difficult and for me  the results are never the same at any time  I adjust in small doses of insulin and carbs - AND wait it out for three hours before adjusting again  During the wait time  I exercise or garden  years ago as a working gal I ran up and down the stairs during break time  What causes the highs and lows  Unbalanced system due to diabetes  Hope it all is OK for you very soon  Joan  -)) Type   Dx Nov   MDI  Humalog and split dose Levemir   Type   Diagnosed for  years as of Nov       Year Type   Medalist Award from Joslin Diabetes Clinic  Harvard Medical School)   Medtronic Paradigm Revel   insulin pump as of March       Insulin  Humalog   Food Allergies  milk  yeast  corn   Hashimoto s thyroid disease   A bit of arthritis   One kidney due to benign Angiomyolipoma    Volunteer Community Disaster Co-Coordinator   Hobbies Interests  Wildlife Naturalists  artist  gardening  music

1	Hi Trisha    Thanks for your wealth of information on meters   I thought too that I should use the Medtronic meter from now on and I will also bring it in to the lab when blood is drawn to compare    I do know that when I was at the Endo office yesterday getting started on my pump we tested my BG on the Ultra  that I had been using and it was   points higher than the one she used on me   She gave me a brand new Ultra  but I am going to use the Medtronic meter that came with my Medtronic  pump    Thanks again  Type   Diagnosed April     MDI s Humalog  Lantus Dexcom G  CGM

2	I m posting a copy of my newest blog entry for you to see    I Lost Another Friend         There have been far too many in the last decade  and another one this weekend  Verna was a very sweet gentle person  she was full of life and enthusiasm  that s what makes it especially sad    I meet Verna several years ago on the ADA message boards  We found that we only lived several miles from each other and so started to meet for meals and great conversations  Verna had been diagnosed with diabetes   years before  after initially high numbers she was able to control with diet  exercise  and just one oral medication  She did very well with this for years  I might also mention that Verna was a breast cancer survivor  about   years prior    Last year she unfortunately had a recurrence of the breast cancer  After further surgery she was given a clean bill of health and scans showed no cancer remaining  All seemed to be fine until late summer when all of a sudden  for no apparent reason  her glucose numbers started climbing into the   -   range  Nothing she did seems to work to lower them  and eventually she was started on a full insulin regime  This worked  and her numbers normalized again    Then around holiday time I got a call from her  she was in the ER and in a lot of pain  Nothing could be found and she was just given pain pills  Two other calls from the ER happened in the coming month until the final  devastating one  She had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer and was starting chemo treatments right away  The cancer had progressed pretty far by that time and within a few months she died    When a thing like this happens you tend to look for a reason why  could anything have been done earlier before it had progressed to the point of no return  It made me think about   other friends I ve lost in the past several years  Lee and Mel  Both were diabetic but in good control  For both their numbers started going out of control for no apparent reason  Shortly after both were diagnosed with cancer    In all   instances an emphasis was put on diabetes  because of the numbers  Many of us know that our numbers tend to be a barometer of what s going on in our body  Sometimes the first hint that we re about to come down with an illness or flair-up of another condition is when our numbers start to increase  The increases are usually not extremely high  just high enough for us to notice  Being under more than normal stress can also do this  When you re diabetic it s normal to think that many things are caused by diabetes  mainly because so many things can be    But I m also wondering in cases such as my friends above  whether a large increase for no apparent reason could also mean that something is wrong with the body that s not necessarily related to diabetes  and the high numbers are just a warning sign  Perhaps more tests should be run on other areas of the body and other causes looked at  it s just too easy to blame everything of being diabetic    Those are just my thoughts  I really don t have any answers  I just really miss my friends  Verna really loved to dance too  her screen name was dance fitness  Verna I hope you re dancing happily on the stars now  with all your pain and troubles far behind    Lizzy Knowledge is Power  Here s some useful links  click on the titles Testing      All About Carbs Resources For The Un-insured and Discount Medicine and Equipment LizzyLou Videos Lizzy s Blog for lots more

0	I think you ve already figured out that all our calories come from either carbs  fat or protein  and that it s the carbs that affect blood sugar   Obviously  then  if you want to keep carbs low  you need to increase fat or protein    Fats that come from vegetable sources are considered healthier than animal fats  so of course avocados and peanut butter are obvious choices  and so are other nuts     You probably won t find a lot of other food that contain a lot of vegetable fat that you are likely to eat in large quantities so it will be a matter of eating a little of this  a little of that  Vegetable oils are found in mayo and salad dressings  as well as margarine  so take advantage of those kinds of additions to salads  or veggies or whatever else you eat     Protein will also add calories   Eggs  cheese and other dairy foods contain both protein and animal fats  so it is up to you to decide whether you need to be especially careful about animal fats  or you want to include them in your diet in reasonable amounts   Lean meats are another option  Many people here tell us that they have found that lowering carbs  rather than strictly controlling animal fat in their diet  has made a significant difference in lowering their cholesterol numbers  You need to find your own balance  and that may depend on your current cholesterol numbers  Molly  aka mollythed) Type   diabetes diagnosed in   now managed with Lantus  Humalog and Metformin  diet and exercise  My husband and three adult sons also have type   diabetes

1	I have never heard of a place for people with diabetes  where you can check in and they will monitor your BGs and what you eat  But I could be wrong  There are diabetes educators  that can help her figure out a lot of things  Have you considered looking in to an insulin pump and or CGM  That would make things easier  Take Care  Jason T  - Diagnosed

2	I think it is important to have respect for each other and for the political process  For example  for years health care premiums have been increasing  -  per year--mine is only going up   this year after they had threatened  before the passage of health care legislation  to bump it up by   And I am supposed to be relieved that the increase is only   But what I read about is people and insurance companies blaming Obamacare    of which has not yet taken effect  for rising insurance premiums  That sounds very political to me  as well as quite inaccurate given the history of previous increases  and rather insulting to the intelligence of the common person  In fact the very term Obamacare applied to a package of reforms worked out by months of negotiations in the context of hundreds of millions of dollars being spent by the health care industry to get it written their way  is at best simplistic and  in my mind  name calling and inaccurate  At a time when a sizable minority of our population have been convinced that our President has a forged birth certificate  and is a Muslim  if not a terrorist  it plays into a very insulting denigration of our political process  The people who voted for health care reform  those who supported it  and the many millions who are disappointed because it phases in too slowly and will not cover everybody  have made an honest attempt to change a system that has us paying double for health care compared to Europe and other industrialized countries while getting poorer health outcomes when you measure things like life expectancy  infant mortality and so on  While I disagree with a number of aspects of the compromise that was passed  I do respect the effort and the courage that resulted in its passage  Our health care system before passage was a national disgrace--the world s richest nation   uninsured and health care ranked  th worldwide  At least now we are doing something about righting that ship--including  by the way  making diabetes coverage mandatory in all   states  Perfect  Of course not  but moving in the right direction  with the opportunity to make more needed changes going forward  We need not only to respect each other here  but we should be respecting the political process as well  regardless of our opinions on what is being done  Morris Diagnosed Type   with an A c of   in    averaging a   A c since then with diet  exercise and Glipizide XL   meds for blood pressure and cholesterol   A bit dated  but scroll down on this page if you want to know more

0	Hi Lena  I ve been using NPH for   years because of the cost factor being much less   It certainly takes some knowledge to use   NPH can peak anywhere from about  -  hours after taking it usually   You really have to try to find out when it peaks with you   How often do you test   The fact that you re using Novolog with it can add to the confusion because if the Novolog is active when the NPH is peaking  extreme lows and passing out could really be the result as you ve seen  My advise would be to keep a log and test as much as possible until you see how the NPH is working  when it is peaking  and how your basal rate is being controlled   I finally got to the point where I dose for the basal rate mainly and eat a low-carb diet so that I don t spike too much with meals   Once you find around what time it peaks you can plan meals around that time as much as possible  at least meals with carbs   I d be very careful about using the Novolog until you determine how the NPH is acting   I d cut down on the Novolog  because if you cut down the NPH you re mainly cutting down on the basal   That s the problem with mixtures     Testing is very important  now more than ever so that you can really see what s happening  Lizzy Knowledge is Power  Here s some useful links  click on the titles Testing      All About Carbs Resources For The Un-insured and Discount Medicine and Equipment LizzyLou Videos Lizzy s Blog for lots more

0	First  congratulations  The best advice I can give for injections is to try not to think about it to much  Being tentative can make it hurt more  so I just tried to do it quickly before I could freak myself out  If it is very hard for you  ask your doctor about glyburide  It is an insulin alternative in pill form  It is not proven to be safe or unsafe in pregnancy so not all doctors will recommend it but mine did  I didn t like it because I only had issues with fasting and the glyburide seemed to make my other numbers harder to control  Good luck  Gestational diabetes Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz

0	I don t want to be responsible for giving you medical advise about something so important  I do want to tell you that urine tests will only detect glucose in urine if it is as high as about  mg dL   That is too high during pregnancy  so a doctor would use a more sensitive lab blood test   A home glucose monitor tests the same thing   While it may not be as precise as a lab test  it would certainly come closer than a urine test  I wonder if the local medical provider has the ability to do the glucose tolerance test   It doesn t require any elaborate testing equiptment  just a measured amount of glucose syrup and the ability to test blood glucose level at marked points over a couple of hours   Perhaps you could take the test  or a close approximation of it  right where you are  even if you want to ask another  outside  provider to evaluate the results  Molly  aka mollythed) Type   diabetes diagnosed in   now managed with Lantus  Humalog and Metformin  diet and exercise  My husband and three adult sons also have type   diabetes

1	My advice is to test  test  test and test some more   Track your numbers so you can see if you need to adjust your basal rate for certain trimes of day  Also  you can also have different insulin carb ratios for different times of the day   Another useful tool once you see our patterns  is to use your temprary basal rate  Let s say that you and I were going to do lunch and then some shopping  We dose for the   lunch and then decide  let s run a marathon - right now   You can suspend your basal and set a temp basal rate   That s what I love about the pump as opposed to MDI  You can t suck out insulin already injeceted  but you can tweak the basal delivery   Hang in there  I would never go back to MDI  Type   -   years Avid Pumper - Would never go back to MDI CGM with Dexcom   - Loving it - Soo very accurate Along with test  test test   - x a day A C for the past   years   - hard work and an a-retentive tendency pays off Portland Oregon

0	Hello Congratulations on the new baby  I had gd with both my pregnancies  Both were healthy  my oldest did end up in nicu for a day but that was because of the mag they gave me for pre eclampsia) and were  lbs  oz and  lbs  The reason why your baby had issues was because your blood sugar was too high right before labor  I was on insulin for both pregnancies and took glyburide briefly with my second but went back to shots because I felt it made it harder for me to control my sugar  I only took it at night to control fasting  If you could share what kind of diet you were eating and how many carbs you were eating per meal  Did you exercise and how  How often were you testing and when  Also your bg will get harder to control between   and   weeks so especially if you are diagnosed early it can be very frustrating getting okay numbers one day and high ones the next when you are eating the same thing  I am sorry you have not been given enough help with this in the past but this is a great place to learn more about controlling diabetes  Georgina Gestational diabetes Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz
1	Ugh  I hate it  I started a new sensor on Friday morning  and all day had the same issues I had in the last   sensors  They work for a few hours  then time out and then I have to recalibrate  which makes it not work for about   hours  Then at my softball game I got a sensor error  that happened all evening  So I ripped it out and haven t turned back  More annoyance than it is worth  frankly  Super upset about it  but I d rather just test  Diagnosed T  January   Pumping since   Diagnosed Raynaud s January   Diagnosed Lupus January
2	I think it s time to get started on getting to the doctor even if it is a nuisance to arrange transportation now  even more than usual    Here is a Mayo Clinic article about Epidermoid cysts  sebaceous cysts)   If it s a true sebaceous cyst  it will have come from a hair follicle  and have an opening to the surface which became plugged long ago  so that all the oil from the sebaceous gland in the hair follicle  and all the dead skin cells become a waxy lump that grows slowly     Once in a while  for no apparent reason  I have had small ones become inflamed  and then they grow quickly  with pus in addition to the waxy stuff  and they can rupture from the pressure    In theory  if you can get it cleaned out it would probably heal up by itself  but when it is large and infected and hard to reach  and there is going to be a large empty pocket left behind  it s much better to get a doctor involved than to risk further damage to surrounding tissue   The doctor may need to make a small slit to make it easier to remove all the gunk and then stitch it shut    Okay  now i want to hear more storm stories   Molly  aka mollythed) Type   diabetes diagnosed in   now managed with Lantus  Humalog and Metformin  diet and exercise  My husband and three adult sons also have type   diabetes
2	Re exercise  there is a nice program called Sit and Be Fit on PBS television stations   In some areas in runs at noon  in other areas   am   So check out the entire   hour period on weekdays and record a few of the programs to see it is something you can enjoy    You really don t need to exercise to lose weight  tho it does help of course   Years ago when I lost almost a hundred pounds  my Weight Watcher s leader was in a wheel chair   Changing the way you eat does the trick   Now  I am not endorsing Weight Watchers because I don t know the new program   When I went  more than   years ago)   it was very low carb   My point is that the leader was in a wheel chair  had lost weight and maintained that weight loss while in a wheel chair

2	I am a Tennessee Master Gardener    I teach organic gardening classes for the University of Tennessee Extension Service every spring    And I have been growing organic fruits and vegetables for   years now    I have a large and very fruitful    TRUE organic growing operation that I maintain      I will attest to the fact that the soils that commercial food is grown on are depleted of the organic material and minerals that plants need in order to provide your own body with the nutrients that they SHOULD be providing    And yes  magnesium is once of the minerals that is severely lacking in most farm soils  and as a result  the foods you are eating are not as magnesium rich as they ought to be      In fact  research funded by the USDA and conducted down at the University of Texas at Austin  published in the main journal of the American Dieticians Association in Dec of  )  compared the actual nutrient composition of commercially purchased fruits and vegetables bought and tested in   and compared these level of these nutrients against the level of nutrients found in commercially purchased food that was bought and tested back in     Those results were still on file - as were details of what tests were performed and how they were performed - and so UT Austin researchers just did the same tests on the same types of vegetables  using veggies they were purchasing in   instead      This research found that -- yes  in fact  there was a SIGNIFICANT reduction of most nutrients in the produce we buy in the stores in our time   to be exact)  compared to the amount of nutrient that these same veggies used to have in them back around       The reason  they suggested  is that farming is done alot differently today than it was back before and during World War       Through the end of World War   chemicals were almost never used on farms     Farming was much more labor intensive back then  and farmers would till the residue from last year s crops back in the soil to turn into compost for the next year    Farm animals were also used to fertilize farm land -- either directly by placing the animals on the land for a year before it was to be planted  or else  by the farmer manually shoveling up the manure and spreading it onto the planting fields      Either way  they did NOT use chemicals on the fields they grew their food in      Something most people don t realize is that God  or Mother Nature  if you prefer) did NOT intend for plants to be fed by artificial means  such as the application of chemical fertilizers      Nature s way of feeding plants is actually to feed the beneficial MICRO-ORGANISMS that live in healthy growing soils    These are beneficial  healthy bacteria and fungi mostly  but there are also small beneficial insects and -- of course -- earthworms        What happens when nature is in control of things  instead of arrogant  know-it-all men) is that beneficial micor-organisms coloniate the land  eating whatever organic matter and mineral dusts happen to be in the soil where they are living    They then --  how can I say this politely ) -- excrete waste materials  manure) into the soil behind them      It so happens that plant roots cannot feast upon the organic matter or mineral dusts in the soil directly    However  the plant roots can -- and do -- absorb the easier to digest manures of the beneficial soil micro-organisms        This is how plants were intended to obtain the nutrients they need to grow   The same nutrients that you eat  when you eat the plants      And since the soil micro-organisms eat a wide variety of organic matter and mineral dusts -- pretty much anything and everything that is available in their growing area -- the plant roots are able to enjoy a wide variety of excreted nutrients  thus providing the plant with a healthier and more rounded diet      The way that food was grown from the Garden of Eden until the years immediately after World War   utlized these natural processes    Farmers knew that they needed to replenish the soil each year  if they wanted a good crop the next year     They might not have realized that what they were really doing was providing food for the soil micro-organisms  who would in turn  make sure their next year s crop was well fed )   Farmers in that day were good stewards of the land      By   however  farming methods were chaning drastically  and unfortunately  US government policy was leading the way in this changeover      As far as feeding plants was concerned  the farmers quit feeding the soil  ie  the soil micro-organisms) as farmers had done for many centuries      They began dumping chemical fertilizers  such as ammonium nitrate  or chemicals identified only by three numbers  or even MIracle Grow) on their crops  instead of building up the soil      Chemical fertilizers tend to do two things very quickly     they kill off the soil microbes that God  Mother Nature) put there to feed the plants  and   they kill off other beneficial soil microbes that God  Mother Nature) put there to help plants fight some of the diseases that normally hit plants as they grow       Not used to thinking about micro-organisms as natural disease fighters    What do you think penicillin is    The fact is that nature provides us with MANY different micro-organisms that can help us fight our own diseases -- as well as plant diseases -- naturally  IF we don t get in nature s way )     Meantime  the chemical fertilizers don t provide a well rounded assortment of nutrients for the plants to thrive on      Most chemical fertilizers only contain the three macro-nutrients  nitrogen  phosphorus and potassium      Whereas soil that is naturally replenished with organic matter and mineral dusts provides a wide variety of nutrients  including  but certainly not limited to) calcium  magnesium  manganese  iron  copper  sulfur  zinc  boron  and a whole bunch of other nutrients that our own bodies need to get when we eat vegetables and fruits      But if these nutrients were never in the soil that the plants grew in  how can that plant later provide us with the nutrients that we ourselves need  when it hits our dinner plate      So  my point in all of this is simply to explain why -- even when we eat a full complement of raw vegetables  cooked vegetables and fresh fruits in our diet -- why we still need to take a high quality multi-vitamin every day      And maybe even a few other dietary supplements as well  if you can afford them      But if money is limited  as it is for many of us)  at least make sure to take a high quality multi-vitamin every day

0	Yes  use the first test  regardless of the time     You might want to try a small snack before exercising   For many people  having something to eat at that point will satisfy your body that you are not starving and make it less likely that your body will send out some of its reserve glucose from storage in the liver to rescue you   It s something you just have to experiment with because not everyone reacts the same way  Just a small handful of nuts or a single cracker with cheese may do it  so the carbs can be very minimal  Molly  aka mollythed) Type   diabetes diagnosed in   now managed with Lantus  Humalog and Metformin  diet and exercise  My husband and three adult sons also have type   diabetes
0	Hello and congratulations on your pregnancy  As you move forward in your pregnancy  you will find your numbers harder to control  This is not your fault  this happens to everyone  Your options are to adjust your diet  increase exercise  and or add increase insulin  Personally  milk would have sent me over the edge every time  liquids will cause you to spike quickly  so you may not see it at  -  hours but it will make overall control harder)  I used unsweetened almond milk instead  I also rarely ate bread as it was one of those things that just wasn t worth it  I ate low carb wraps instead  Regardless  check the nutrition label for carb content as a lot of people automatically equate whole wheat with healthy and bread companies take advantage of that  For fruit  are you choosing berries and melons  These give you the best bang for your buck as far as carbs go  Bananas are the worst  The other thing is how you eat your carbs  I could eat a medium sized apple without spiking  if  I ate it with  -  oz of cheese  The fat and protein balanced the carbs  Of course  what I could handle at   weeks was different from what I could handle at   weeks which will all be totally different from you  I did not follow the diet I was given  I would have been on insulin  x a day  I went lower carb  especially for breakfast  she said I could have   servings of carbs but I had to keep it to  ) but this is something you have to feel comfortable with  My doctors knew  I was healthy and my babies were healthy  Do what works for you  If you can do any kind of exercise  that also helps  Even walking or housework will help  I never succeeded in getting my fasting down without insulin  up to   units of humilin-n) but a small handful of almonds at night sometimes helped  Good luck getting your numbers where you want them to be  Gestational diabetes Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz
0	I agree with sachi that a c-section is not inevitable   On the other hand  it can become the safest option if your baby gains a lot of weight during the last weeks of pregnancy   We know that the baby is most likely to gain excess weight if there is extra glucose in YOUR blood  so the very best thing you can do for yourself and your baby right now is to manage your own eating to keep your blood glucose level as close to normal as you possibly can   It takes real discipline but it can pay big dividends   Testing can feel like a bother  but it is the best way for you to inform yourself about what is  or is not working  and make changes in your eating as needed   Then as you move closer to delivery  your doctor can reassess the need for c-section    Yes  there has been a new outlook on gestational diabetes in the last few years   High blood sugar early in pregnancy is now considered to be developing type   diabetes that just becomes a little more obvious under the extra testing in early pregnancy   It s the high blood glucose later in pregnancy that is diagnosed as gestational diabetes   Molly  aka mollythed) Type   diabetes diagnosed in   now managed with Lantus  Humalog and Metformin  diet and exercise  My husband and three adult sons also have type   diabetes
1	hi im   and have had D since i was   I hate to say this but sometimes you have bad spurts  Sometimes you get caught up in school  personal issues or kids haha  It s never good but it happens to all of us You are reaching out so obviously you care  I never used a pump but maybe you need to try shots  i think you should check you blood sugar more often as thats the best place to start and then your lomg term insulin  When i experience more highs i usually ho up a unit or two  Also keep a journal  It s thr best secret i have  Write down your numbers what you eat what your sugars are after you eat and so on  This will show you whether you re ratio is right or maybe you re eating certain foods that your body has trouble with  No matter what you should start seeing a pattern  and the more you check and are aware of your sugars the better you will probably keep them good luck

0	Most people with GD can control it with diet and exercise  so there is hope  If you can stay off insulin meds then your care providers may let you go longer before they ll want to induce and so there is a good chance you will go into spontaneous labor and have the type of labor delivery you want to have    Some things that help me      Try walking   minute after as many meals as possible   Save your carbs for later in the day if you spike after breakfast   Experiement with different pre-bed snacks  for me    hardboiled eggs work best at keeping down my fasting number)   Thinner carbs like whole grain tortillas and whole-wheat pita pockets may cause less of a spike than other bready things   Let me know if you need more advice    history of gestational diabetes  Also T  runs in the family  Long-term vegetarian  years)

1	ajsammycat  ) and while you are on this honeymoon ride  a lower carb diet will probably make life a bit easier for you  You re recommending a low-carb diet to someone who takes only   unit of insulin for every   grams of carbohydrates he eats  So  exactly how is he supposed to accommodate this  if he eats Bernstein-like  and eats only  g carbs per day  For the sake of easier calculations  let s make it  g carbs per day  split over   meals per day  That s   grams of carbs PER MEAL  which means a mere   units of  log per meal  Tell me  where can you get a syringe that allows you to calculate a dose that small  because I certainly would like a syringe that accurate  Hate to come off as so harsh  but seriously  folks  Not every diabetes ill can be ameliorated by eating food plans that were used prior to the discovery of insulin  Angela No  it just means if he doesn t eat a meal of   grams of carbs he doesn t bolus  I have the same issue  in a honeymoon stage  pancreas works  then doesn t basal set  then not enough  yes  it is a nightmare  i was told to only take     unit of novolog for   -   grams of carbs)  i haven t even done it yet  i just continue to eat low carbs and my body can sit process about   grams of carbs per meal  this honeymoon phase is NO fun

1	Hey everyone - if you know of an organization or establishment that would like to meet Doug  please let us know   You can contact me at  - -  or carriecarlson sbglobal net and I ll get you in touch with Doug  He s a huge inspiration    November     Doug Masiuk of  Run   www OneRun org)  intends to make history by being the first Type   diabetic to run across the United States  And he s   of the way there  From November   to November     Masiuk will be continuing his run across central Indiana and into Ohio  connecting with groups and individuals to inspire them to do better  But he can t do it alone  Since May   Masiuk has run over   miles  Along the way he has met over   people in hospitals  retirement homes  kids camps  universities  schools and support groups  As he gets closer to reaching his goal  interest in his story is growing  As of November  th  he is about   miles from New York City  his final destination  He is looking for help connecting with locals  as well as logistical support including lodging  donations  meals  connections with local families and groups  In   Masiuk  who has had diabetes since he was three years old  realized that sitting in a office chair was not going to give him the lifespan and quality of life that he desired  While he had good control of his diabetes  to have chance to live into his  s  he knew he needed to do it better than the next guy   He decided to start running  That first night he went less than an   of a mile  Two days later he went   mile plus   feet   He was motivated by the improvements in overall health  need for insulin  as well as his more stable glucose levels  Four years later  he embarked on this journey to be the first Type   diabetic to run across the country  I am doing this for everyone  not just diabetics and their families  said Masiuk  who downplays the significance of his diabetes during his journey  We must all take our health into our own hands  Not everyone needs to take drastic measures to turn their life around  but I m hoping to inspire the people that I meet and who read about my journey to do whatever it takes to have good health  Masiuk talks to groups about getting their   minutes of exercise a day and making better dietary choices  At times during the journey  he has had the support of a friend or volunteer who could drive his car to his next destination and make sure that he was safe  But as with any volunteer situation  they have lives to get back to  So Doug is currently driving ahead   miles and storing his bicycle  then driving back to his starting point  He then completes his run  then gets on his bike and rides the   miles back to his vehicle  He is actively seeking someone who can escort him for the remaining six weeks of his journey  There are times that I have thought I wasn t going to make it  says Masiuk  In an especially poignant blog post  he talks about running   miles  then riding   miles in a downpour  It s been more difficult that I imagined  but I m too close to think about quitting  What keeps me going is the support of friends and family  as well as the people I ve met along the way  I am doing this for the people who have faced loss in the wake of diabetes  from the  -year old who is facing kidney complications to that family that is learning that their child has diabetes today  Exercise is tricky for Type   diabetics  who must maintain a careful balance of carbohydrates and insulin to achieve a safe and healthy blood glucose level  Since Type   diabetes is an auto-immune condition in which the body kills insulin producing cells  diabetics must manually deliver insulin via syringe or an insulin pump  Many things can have an impact on blood sugar  including illness  stress  weather  and exercise  Exercise is wonderful for burning up extra glucose  but running   to   miles a day is another level of diabetes maintenance  Extreme low blood glucose levels  which are dangerous and potentially fatal  can happen at any time  Masiuk notes that his insulin needs have dropped about   during his cross-country run  About  Run  Run was formed to bring awareness to the diabetes epidemic that continues to grow globally  Diabetes  one of the fastest growing chronic diseases in the country  is manageable and at times can be preventable for Type   diabetics  Many Americans unwittingly  opt in  to this debilitating disease when they make poor dietary and lifestyle decisions  Type   and Type   diabetes have devastating effects for one s quality of life and our healthcare system  Families supporting a loved one face emotional and financial hardship just for basic daily needs such as insulin  syringes  and test strips for monitoring  These consequences can be dramatically reduced if people are willing to change what they eat and how often they move  Masiuk has been successful managing his disease and is sharing his story with Americans while running through their backyards  You can read

1	I am still fairly new to being a Type   as I was diagnosed last year in April at the age of    I did   shots a day for   months before I finally said enough of that  I want to try a pump   I m not going to lie and say I wasn t terrified those first few days that the pump was actually working  because I was very scared that something would go wrong or that it wasn t working but after being on it for a month now  I just don t ever see me going back to shots   My numbers have been AMAZING and I am not having nearly as many lows as I was while I was shooting myself up  My endo isn t the kind that pushes stuff on me because she wants me to make my own choices but when I asked her about getting a pump  she put it this way to me   You can continue to do what you are doing with the shots which is kind of like driving a Ford Escort OR you can trade in and get a pump which is like driving a Mercedes I am LOVING my Mercedes     Like the post above me  I am on the Metronic minimed pump and it wasn t cheap but Metronic will work with you as much as possible plus they do have awesome customer service   The training wasn t difficult  changing the infusion site is so much better than doing   shots a day since I can go four days on one set  and just the complete freedom of having the pump makes having this horrible disease some what barable     Good luck with your decision  Jamie Type   since April of   A C     A C     A C     A C     MEDRONIC PUMP USER since December   THYROID DISEASE-HOSHIMOTO S DISEASE

0	hello    I guess using the word reverse   manage   control is a matter of semantics   To me  what it really comes down to is HOW you want to deal with the fact you have GD or type   diabetes         I just see too often individuals taking the medication route too quickly   If there is the proper guidance UP FRONT - from a dietician or health coach on a regular basis  then the odds of having to resort to medications can be reduced   I see patients sent off to figure out their diet on their own maybe with a handout and maybe with a one hour  orientation only to return to their next visit not having made much progress   It is one thing to know what you should and should not eat but with proper support on a regular basis with someone who can give you the attention you need then you CAN get those blood sugars down     Unfortunately   I also see that doctors are not very vocal about what you have to look forward to down the road when you get older if you choose to rely on medication and not be really diligent about eating healthy   By then  it really is too late and you are more than likely dependent on medication because your liver and other organs are just too damaged    Being diagnosed with GD does not give you much time to get your blood sugars under control   Ask for a referral to a dietician or health coach who can work with you one on one as soon as possible and on a weekly basis  or more often if needed  )  You will have much more success at  controlling your numbers and getting healthier for you and baby     Donna

0	donnarock wrote  good morning    First of all it is quite normal to be panicking right now   There are many concerns with having GD but the good news is you CAN manage it and reverse it will the right changes in your diet     I am glad to hear your doctor has set up an appointment with a nutritionist   Take advantage of their help and make sure they sit down with you and give you a plan to follow to help you replace the bad carbs  breads  pastas  sweets etc) with healthier foods    Unfortunately when we are pregnant we think this is the time to eat whatever we want   But GD does not happen just to women who eat junk food   I know of a woman from Italy   who would make fresh  homemade pasta and other Italian dishes  only to find out she had GD during her pregnancy     Another reason to try not to stress out right now is stress can actually affect your blood sugar levels   Try doing things that will hlep you relax   deep breathing  listening to music  simple yoga for pregnant women  etc    I wish you the best of luck and you CAN reverse your GD    Donna   Donna You can t reverse gd any more than you can reverse type   You can control it  sometimes with the help of insulin but the only way to reverse gd is by giving birth  Gestational diabetes Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz

0	It sounds like what we call the dawn phenomenon  The rise in blood glucose comes not so much from what you eat for breakfast as from your body s reserve supply that is stored in your liver    It s normal for everyone  pregnant or not  diabetic or not  to call on that reserve to get started in the morning  The difference is that for people with more normal metabolism  the increase in blood glucose is paired with a release of insulin from the pancreas to balance it off  so the result is new energy for your body  but no great increase in blood glucose level     Of course  eating fewer carbs at that first meal may help  but there are a few other strategies  like eating as soon as possible after getting up  or eating a little more at bedtime  including some fats and proteins  that can help you avoid the morning increase  Each of us is different  so it can take some trial and error to figure out what works for you   For some people  it even helps to have a small snack  like perhaps a handfull of nuts  if they wake up to use the bathroom in the hours before they plan to get up and stay up    It might not be a bad idea either  to keep in mind that your real goal is not to avoid meds or insulin at all costs  The real goal is to manage blood glucose  This is a disease process   not a test of will power  Some people just need outside help  and it is no sign of failure to take advantage of help if your body needs it  Sure  do what you can  but be adaptable  for your baby s sake  Molly  aka mollythed) Type   diabetes diagnosed in   now managed with Lantus  Humalog and Metformin  diet and exercise  My husband and three adult sons also have type   diabetes

2	HappyHen wrote  I am a Tennessee Master Gardener    I teach organic gardening classes for the University of Tennessee Extension Service every spring    And I have been growing organic fruits and vegetables for   years now    I have a large and very fruitful    TRUE organic growing operation that I maintain      I will attest to the fact that the soils that commercial food is grown on are depleted of the organic material and minerals that plants need in order to provide your own body with the nutrients that they SHOULD be providing    And yes  magnesium is once of the minerals that is severely lacking in most farm soils  and as a result  the foods you are eating are not as magnesium rich as they ought to be      In fact  research funded by the USDA and conducted down at the University of Texas at Austin  published in the main journal of the American Dieticians Association in Dec of  )  compared the actual nutrient composition of commercially purchased fruits and vegetables bought and tested in   and compared these level of these nutrients against the level of nutrients found in commercially purchased food that was bought and tested back in     Those results were still on file - as were details of what tests were performed and how they were performed - and so UT Austin researchers just did the same tests on the same types of vegetables  using veggies they were purchasing in   instead      This research found that -- yes  in fact  there was a SIGNIFICANT reduction of most nutrients in the produce we buy in the stores in our time   to be exact)  compared to the amount of nutrient that these same veggies used to have in them back around       The reason  they suggested  is that farming is done alot differently today than it was back before and during World War       Through the end of World War   chemicals were almost never used on farms     Farming was much more labor intensive back then  and farmers would till the residue from last year s crops back in the soil to turn into compost for the next year    Farm animals were also used to fertilize farm land -- either directly by placing the animals on the land for a year before it was to be planted  or else  by the farmer manually shoveling up the manure and spreading it onto the planting fields      Either way  they did NOT use chemicals on the fields they grew their food in      Something most people don t realize is that God  or Mother Nature  if you prefer) did NOT intend for plants to be fed by artificial means  such as the application of chemical fertilizers      Nature s way of feeding plants is actually to feed the beneficial MICRO-ORGANISMS that live in healthy growing soils    These are beneficial  healthy bacteria and fungi mostly  but there are also small beneficial insects and -- of course -- earthworms        What happens when nature is in control of things  instead of arrogant  know-it-all men) is that beneficial micor-organisms coloniate the land  eating whatever organic matter and mineral dusts happen to be in the soil where they are living    They then --  how can I say this politely ) -- excrete waste materials  manure) into the soil behind them      It so happens that plant roots cannot feast upon the organic matter or mineral dusts in the soil directly    However  the plant roots can -- and do -- absorb the easier to digest manures of the beneficial soil micro-organisms        This is how plants were intended to obtain the nutrients they need to grow   The same nutrients that you eat  when you eat the plants      And since the soil micro-organisms eat a wide variety of organic matter and mineral dusts -- pretty much anything and everything that is available in their growing area -- the plant roots are able to enjoy a wide variety of excreted nutrients  thus providing the plant with a healthier and more rounded diet      The way that food was grown from the Garden of Eden until the years immediately after World War   utlized these natural processes    Farmers knew that they needed to replenish the soil each year  if they wanted a good crop the next year     They might not have realized that what they were really doing was providing food for the soil micro-organisms  who would in turn  make sure their next year s crop was well fed )   Farmers in that day were good stewards of the land      By   however  farming methods were chaning drastically  and unfortunately  US government policy was leading the way in this changeover      As far as feeding plants was concerned  the farmers quit feeding the soil  ie  the soil micro-organisms) as farmers had done for many centuries      They began dumping chemical fertilizers  such as ammonium nitrate  or chemicals identified only by three numbers  or even MIracle Grow) on their crops  instead of building up the soil      Chemical fertilizers tend to do two things very quickly     they kill off the soil microbes that God  Mother Nature) put there to feed the plants  and   they kill off other beneficial soil microbes that God  Mother Nature) put there to help plants fight some of the diseases that normally hit plants as they grow       Not used to thinking about micro-organisms as natural disease fighters    What do you think penicillin is    The fact is that nature provides us with MANY different micro-organisms that can help us fight our own diseases -- as well as plant diseases -- naturally  IF we don t get in nature s way )     Meantime  the chemical fertilizers don t provide a well rounded assortment of nutrients for the plants to thrive on      Most chemical fertilizers only contain the three macro-nutrients  nitrogen  phosphorus and potassium      Whereas soil that is naturally replenished with organic matter and mineral dusts provides a wide variety of nutrients  including  but certainly not limited to) calcium  magnesium  manganese  iron  copper  sulfur  zinc  boron  and a whole bunch of other nutrients that our own bodies need to get when we eat vegetables and fruits      But if these nutrients were never in the soil that the plants grew in  how can that plant later provide us with the nutrients that we ourselves need  when it hits our dinner plate      So  my point in all of this is simply to explain why -- even when we eat a full complement of raw vegetables  cooked vegetables and fresh fruits in our diet -- why we still need to take a high quality multi-vitamin every day      And maybe even a few other dietary supplements as well  if you can afford them      But if money is limited  as it is for many of us)  at least make sure to take a high quality multi-vitamin every day      I fully agree with you Happy  and have studied these methods for almost thirty years    I have always maintained that you aren t getting the nutrients you think because of soil and farming storage methods and that taking a multi-vit is wise for everyone   I ve heard a lot of flack about it over the years  maybe you ll have better luck    I also know the importance of magnesium in diabetes  and also another condition I have   I took part if a study of it at Georgetown hosp  about   years ago   That s what got me interested in nutrition and holistic health methods   I ve also studied them for many years    Lizzy Knowledge is Power  Here s some useful links  click on the titles Testing      All About Carbs

0	Thank you for taking the time to respond   I had my OB appointment yesterday   I was still pretty upset when I got there  but I feel a bit better after speaking with her    I am now considered a high risk pregnancy  probably due to more issues than just the GD)   I really didn t want that because that could lead to a high intervention pregnancy  delivery  and birth no matter what good things I try to do   As long as everything goes well  my regular OB will be able to continue seeing me  and I won t have to make appointments with other doctors   My GD does not mean that I will automatically go on bedrest or have a c-section  or even deliver early  even though she expressed that she doesn t think I will make it to   weeks because I have had pre enclampsia that made me have to be induced early twice)   As long as I try to keep my blood sugar under control  she says that things should go pretty normally    One thing that is a problem is that I have to go to the doctor every week until I deliver   This could adversely affect my job because I am basically a contract employee that can be called out without much notice  Many times I don t know that I am going to work until I get a call at   a m   If I can t make it at that time  they are not going to want to see me at   a m  or later because I am at the doctor s office having my blood sugar done at the lab   I really wish they would let me test it at home   As I expressed in my earlier post  my family needs all the money that we can get right now  and any days I miss make a BIG difference   She will at least let me do my OB appointments at the same time as my blood glucose lab appointments  because I will have to wait around at the hospital anyway   I am sure that sometimes these appointments will fall on days when no one calls me anyway  which will be a good thing    I now have to take Glyburide  mg I think once a day  I am getting it filled today)   I don t know how that will turn out    I am concerned that no matter what I do  things might turn out badly due to no one s fault   I am going to be really disappointed  again  if I am trying to eat right  moderately exercise  count carbs and calories  miss work due to doctor s appointments every week and still end up put on insulin  put on bedrest  at home or at the hospital)   possibly having to drive long distances to see additional doctors  and have a c-section   But now if that does happen  at least I would be able to say that I tried to do everything I could to prevent that from happening   I won t have to feel guilty that I just got mad  gave up  and didn t even try

0	Hi girl  From your post I gather you are one of the unlucky ones whose morning sickness has been especially difficult-for some it never goes away  I had three horrible pregnancies  myself  due to severe  unrelenting morning sickness  I feel for you  if that has plagued you  It appears you feel weak with hunger  or from blood sugar ups and downs  My thinking is that you have to choose low carb  and as balanced as you can  from those foods you can tolerate  If you can choose some good protein sources and cook once  eat twice  that can help you when the shakes come on  Like cook enough chicken breast  slice for on top of salads  so meals can be quick and easy for you  I ve seen where some people bake eggs in muffin tins  for fast re-heating later  If you feel ill when chopping and prepping dinner  indulge in some shortcut ingredients for the time being-chopped peppers  chopped onions  wherever shortcuts exist  If extra hormones are causing your body to feel overheated  delegate oven and stove top meal prep chores when possible if fixing food gives you the shakes or makes you feel like you are about to pass out  begin small meal prep tasks earlier than usual  and use a stool at the counter  or take the cutting  slicing  mixing  etc  to the table  to sit while you work  Making use of small appliances that don t  heat you up  when cooking  can help avert that shakey feeling that heat in your face can set in motion  This is a great time for moms to drop by a meal now and then  if that is an option  I am sure you will find many good recipes and tips  not only here  but at your nutrition consult  Good luck to you  Girlsaylor Girlsaylor If you are willing to let someone lead you  make sure he is worthy  Early T  Diabetes  a Lizzy-ism) A C   as of April   A c   Dec   A C   March   FBG   March   Weight loss  April       August      December        April

2	If your weight is staying the same but your clothes are fitting better  that is a really good sign that you are losing fat and gaining muscle  By volume  fat weighs less than muscle   As a perhaps disturbing analogy to help you understand  butter floats in the water  while meat sinks because it is heavier than the water   Another thing to keep in mind is that when your blood glucose is up above about   your kidneys go to work removing glucose out of your blood and into urine   That means that you are literally throwing away some of the energy  the calories  from the food you eat   Sure  you are eating less  but your body can now actually USE the food you eat instead of tossing it out to protect itself   At a thousand calories  you certainly don t need to cut back serving sizes any more  but it  just may be that you were getting less value than you thought out of the food you used to eat  Molly  aka mollythed) Type   diabetes diagnosed in   now managed with Lantus  Humalog and Metformin  diet and exercise  My husband and three adult sons also have type   diabetes

2	Hi  D   It might make some difference what the doc is eating for that meal  if this happens continually or only once in a while  and what the number was before the meal   It is interesting that the doc knows what the number is after the meal   That suggests to me that she suspects pre-diabetes or diabetes   I never tested myself until I was diagnosed   My doctor did not suggest it even when I got a   on my FBG at the lab     In the long run  what counts for you is not whether your doctor is in denial about her own condition  but the care she is giving you   If that care is good  then I wouldn t worry about it   If  in fact  your doctor has diabetes or develops diabetes  that reality will intrude on her pretty soon - doctors tend to make sure they get pretty good annual physicals  and they know much better than we do what symptoms to look out for   A diabetic doctor will know a lot more about diabetes and the treatment of it than a non-diabetic doctor  and be much more sympathetic)  so this could turn out to be an advantage for your doctor s diabetic patients   I would not wish diabetes on anyone  I hope your doctor is not diabetic and does not become diabetic  but we are just observers  there isn t anything we can do about it   I m just suggesting that your doctor being diabetic isn t something for you to worry about  George Diagnosed T    A C   Metformin   mg    x daily since   A C     A C     A C     Weight at diagnosis     Weight

2	joyabba  ) I do suspect that employers are passing on insurance costs to employees  not because of any Obama reforms  but hoping the employees will blame it on Obama  I don t think they are hoping people will blame Obama for passing on costs to employees  This started long before Obama was elected  The problem is that benefits are so costly to employers that they can no longer afford to provide them at little or no cost and remain competitive in a global marketplace  If you look at the auto industry  the US has lost a lot of it to Canada  Ontario is the leading producer of automobiles in North America  dealing a serious blow to Michigan and Ohio  two auto producing states  Ontario advertises that health care costs to auto manufacturers are half that of what it costs them in the US  A few years back it was shown that it cost   less to produce a car in Canada than it does in the US  If you were the auto company  what would you do  You are  after all  in business to turn a profit  You have a fiduciary responsibility to your shareholders  The expectation in the US is that health benefits are provided through employment  but we are finding that fewer and fewer companies offer benefits and a lot that do leave the employee seriously underinsured  Clinging to this model of health care is exacerbating the problem  On a striclty economic note  we are currently spending   out of every   on health care  leaving little for other goods and services  This is strangling our economy  We ve paid attention to the supply side of economics  but it is time to look at the demand side of it as well  As long as we continue to put so much money into one sector of the economy  there will not be complete recovery  In   an official from the Government Accounting Office stated that health care costs were the biggest competitive challenge facing American businesses  Debbie

1	I believe the three hour   gram oral glucose tolerance test is the one done to determine if pregnant women have gestational diabetes   I think it is only done for those who show a high glucose level on a shorter one hour test  We can guess that it might have been an error on the part of the doctor  or the lab  to have done the three hour test instead of the usual two hour test  with   grams of glucose test  but we can t tell for sure why it was done  Molly  aka mollythed) Type   diabetes diagnosed in   now managed with Lantus  Humalog and Metformin  diet and exercise  My husband and three adult sons also have type   diabetes

1	Hi - As Jeremiah said  it may be a bad honeymoon but a carb insulin ratio of   may indicate that you are using too much basal  That would be consistent with an inability to walk for more than   minutes without going low - unless you try to walk right after meals  In that case  you might just have to wait for   hours after meals to exercise  That is my situation  How much insulin do you take each day and how much is basal  Maurie Maurie Diagnosed T    at the age of   Pumping humalog with a Deltec Cozmo
1	I just read all five pages of your struggle  Acidrock  I have a couple of suggestions  The meter beeps all night  based on your low setting  My trainer suggested setting it at   as it would be off about   points  Since   is pretty usual for me  it went off all night  I changed the low reading to   and it went off a lot less  Also  you can set the timing of when it will beep again  My trainer said   minutes for lows and an hour for highs  Well  in the middle of the night when I am low  it will beep every   minutes  so I changed it to an hour  which lessened the problem  I had a night last night where it did not want to go up  and it beeped every hour on the hour  But  although frustrated  I was glad  as I was really low  kept drinking juice  and avoided a visit from the paramedics  Not much sleep  though  I posted this a couple of times  I make my CGM go   days  Here is what I do  I insert the new sensor on Saturday and cover it with a bandaid  I leave the old one in place  When I get up on Sunday  I remove the old sensor  charge the transmitter and then attach it to the new sensor  As the sensor has been in for quite a while  I do not get the ISIGs that go wildly high and low  and cause sensor errors  Usually the wait time to calibrate is   hours  and it will usually beep in about   hours  The only probalem I have ever had is when I try to make it go longer  After   days the charge seems to go  and I need to change  Usually  I just remove it overnight when that happens  As far as calibrating goes  I calibrate when I get up  before lunch and dinner and before bed  I try to follow the rules of not calibrating unless the reading is between   and   but I find that is not necessary  I was on steroids a while back  and my BGs were skyrocketing  As I needed to calibrate when it was high  I just did  I found my readings were even more accurate  Someone posted a while ago to do the first calibration with a new sensor  and recalibrate   minutes later  I have found this to be good advice--it seems to make the readings more accurate  One thing about the minmed CGM  I asked my endo about all the discussions here on the board about the MM CGM and inaccuracy  He said that each type of CGM is really meant for a different type of person  Like Harley  and his work  the other systems work better for people like him  My endo is a good guy and a researcher  so I felt better with that response  Sometimes my CGM readings and meter readings are right on  Ocassionally  they are not  You still have to test a lot  Good luck with this  and try not to be frustrated  I just have to remember that I have not been visited by the paramedics  or thrown my husband into fix it mode in a year  since I have had the CGM  For me  that makes all the stuff worthwhile

2	dinycat  ) Nobody in the United States is being denied access to healthcare  Just look at our Emergency Rooms  There are signs all over stating that fact  and I truly believe there is no difference in the care received  Matter of fact  we give our indigent enough money that they don t have to work  and can spend it in Las Vegas  Hawaii  and on cruise ships   See current news headlines ) As far as the Canadian health program  why is it that people like Peter Jennings and the Labrador minister  Danny Williams  come to the U S  for treatment  Honestly  I m really not trying to be fomenting or argumentative  I like Canada  my mother was born in Saskatchewan  But you really shouldn t tout your country and healthcare too much  or you just might experience a mass exodus from the south--and then you ll be in the same boat we are  Bleeding Cubbie blue  dinycat Do you imagine that those people who get health care in emergency rooms are somehow getting free healthcare  Sure  there are people who are charged on a sliding scale  and even some who don t have to pay out of pocket because they are indigent but it is NOT free  Know who pays when they can t  YOU do  It would actually be cheaper to you  if those hospitals didn t receive federal dollars to provide that care  but since it s invisible to most tax payers  they think that the hospitals are giving these services away as a kind of charitible contribution or something or at worst passing it along to other hospitalized people  That may be true too  I don t know  but I do know that hospitals receive federal funds to help with those costs  It s not free it s not charity  SOMEone pays  Talvie Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one s courage  Anais Nin Type   Diabetes diagnosed December     w A c of   June   A c   Controlling with diet and exercise  and  mg daily of metformin

0	Good Morning    You are very wise to be thinking about this now  before you get pregnant   I am assuming you have Type   Diabetes   The ideal would be to start  making the changes you need to your diet now - so you can stop taking insulin and cholesterol medication   Your high cholesterol will go down also with a better diet    Write down everything you eat for at least a week   Start looking at the ingredients in packaged foods   A lot of times packaged foods have High Fructose Corn syrup which is bad for your blood sugars AND your cholesterol   Are you drinking sodas   Breads     Once you get an honest picture of what you are eating  then you can make a plan for replacing the unhealthy foods with better foods     Good for you for wanting to get healthier before you are pregnant   Hopefully you will continue with your quest to eat healthier even after you have children  I work with the elderly in nursing homes and see the impact of Diabetes - foot amputations  impaired eye site  neuropathy it is very sad and many have been on insulin for years  so Insulin and other meds are not really the solution    take care and good luck     Donna

2	Josh  the best advice I can offer is to stop worrying about the calories at all  Just use common sense on portion sizes modified by feedback from your meter  Read those links I provided again  Roger that  Thank you for the links again btw  I read alot of your blog when I was on my lunch breaks at work over the past couple of work days  still reading that and all the links provided within my posts)

0	Its really hard for us to know what is going on from the little information you have  I m assuming that up until now  you ve had no diagnosis of diabetes of any kind   I don t know what caused you to seek help and have the IVs  Normally  when we eat  our digestive systems turn all the sugars and starches we eat into a sugar called glucose   The glucose is absorbed out of the digestive tract and into the blood and then it is carried off to the rest of our bodies   Most of it goes to our muscles   We need insulin to unlock the muscle cells and let the glucose in   When we need energy to move  the muscles cells burn the glucose  When a person doesn t have enough glucose and they start to run short on energy  they can burn fat instead   The problem with that is that the fat doesn t burn as cleanly the glucose  so just like a wood fire  it leaves behing some waste products   Ketones are the waste products from burning fat   When people have diabetes  and they can t get the glucose into the muscles  because they don t have enough insulin  or the insulin doesn t work as well as it should  they end up burning fat and producing ketones  Even people without diabetes can produce ketones if they take in less food than they need  and start burning fat   People on the Atkins diet sometimes try to eat so few carbs  sugar and starches) that they purposely start burning fat and look for ketones as a sign that they are successfully burning fat   A pregnant woman might run out of food energy if she goes all the way from supper until breakfast the next morning without eating for ten or twelve hours  The ketones can go out the same way the glucose came in  through the muscle cell walls and into blood  and be carried to the kidneys and excreted in urine   That s no big deal as long as there are only trace amounts of ketones   The clear problem is when there moderate or large amounts of ketones  they will be toxic  and nobody wants a developing baby exposed to that kind of poison  I certainly don t know for sure  but I would GUESS from the way the medical people responded  that they found only trace amounts of ketones  and that is why they are not very concerned at this point   During the last trimester of pregnancy  if a woman has too much glucose in her blood  because it isn t getting into her muscles  that also means that too much glucose is going to the baby through the placenta   Then it s as if the baby were overeating and the baby can put on too much weight  making labor and delivery more difficult   That s why the glucose tolerance test  to see if your body can handle a large influx of glucose properly  is done at   weeks  as you are just about entering those last three months   Molly  aka mollythed) Type   diabetes diagnosed in   now managed with Lantus  Humalog and Metformin  diet and exercise  My husband and three adult sons also have type   diabetes
2	I agree with you that Novolin insulin is less predictable and harder to manage that the newer long-lasting and rapid-acting insulins   While Rodney says he uses Novolin N  there is nothing to indicate that he is taking a Novolin mixture instead of plain Novolin N    Novolin N is NPH   It s the same thing   My package insert even calls it both   And Novolin N does act as a mixture  I know because I ve used it for over   years    Lizzy Knowledge is Power  Here s some useful links  click on the titles Testing      All About Carbs Resources For The Un-insured and Discount Medicine and Equipment LizzyLou Videos Lizzy s Blog for lots more
0	I was also diagnosed late in prenancy and have yet to deliver  I started managing it right away and my doctor does not believe we have any cause for concern  I would interview as many OB s as possible until you find one that is sympathetic to your concerns and seems to have the same view on labor and delievery as you do  Also  make sure you eat right from the beginning so there is less to worry about  I had a horrible experience with my first child during labor and delivery so I looked for a clinic and hospital that fit me better with my second and I am going to deliver there with my third  I plan on having a natural birth  when managed correctly normal births are definately a possibility  Did you go over due  Was your baby really big  Some OB s are more confortable inducing to reduce the change that the baby gets to big  from everything I have learned it is not necessary though  Best of luck

1	I saw just parts of the show because I was busy with a cooking project    I noticed too that Dr  Phil didn t distinguish between T  and T  but at least he included some members of each group   Maybe I found it a little more revealing to see that he included himself at the end of the list because I have sometimes wondered if he might have T  even if I am not really pleased to hear that anyone has any kind of diabetes    Sure  it could have been an opportunity to do more education about diabetes and the difference between type   and type   but I do think that the message that kids  and young adults  with diabetes are just as responsible for their own behavior as anybody else  and that neither they nor their parents can afford to overlook that  or use diabetes as an excuse for irresponsible behavior is so terribly important that it was well worth the whole show just to make that one point   Have you ever notice how often there is some little point like that tucked in near the end of the show that really sums up the whole thing    Bot parents and son did say that the son had done well managing diabetes in his teens   I suspect he does know a lot more than he shows  There was a sort of Peter Pan  I-don t-wanna-grow-up attitude that may be masking his own fear and anger over having to be responsible for himself    If I were writing to the Dr  Phil show  I guess might be encouraging them to do more shows with more information about diabetes rather than complaining about what was missing from this one  Molly  aka mollythed) Type   diabetes diagnosed in   now managed with Lantus  Humalog and Metformin  diet and exercise  My husband and three adult sons also have type   diabetes

0	My daughter is   weeks pregnant and has recently been diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes   She has met with a dietictian and has been shown how to test her blood sugar levels after meals   The suggested levels they have put her on     hour after meals) seems to be difficult for her to reach   She is regularly between   and     hour after each meal   They are now considering putting her on insulin   I am concerned because the levels I am finding recommended are   after   hour and   after   hours   Any suggestions

0	I m   weeks and was tested since I m considered high risk  one test was over what it should be so they diagnosed me with gd  Just because you are diagonosed early does not mean you have type   diabetes  I was tested before I got pregnant and wasn t even borderline diabetic  It is scary when you first find out  it s alot to take on  We had to do infertility treatments to get pregnant so it was very nerve racking for me to find out

0	thank you for your comment lizzy  and I can attest to what your Doctor is saying Faeli  I am nearing the end of my pregnancy and they have had me in a pretty tight range because it keep the baby safe and once you reach your third trimester your placenta creates a anti insulin and you will run very high if your not in a tight range  here is what my range looks like   am- am  -   am- pm  -   pm- am  -  Good luck and remember that they only are keeping you this tight to ensure that you have a health baby because high BG = heavy baby  -stephanie  aka anie ) Misdiagnosed Type   at the age of   rediagnosed Type   at the age of   after DKA   Total years with Diabetes   Pumping Humalog in the Medtronic Revel   and Loving it

0	Hi everyone   I m   weeks pregnant with my second and just starting checking blood sugar levels yesterday   I m checking levels four times a day - first thing in the morning and one hour after breakfast  lunch and dinner   Now  my dietician told me to check one hour after I  begin  to eat each meal   Does that sound right   That means that if it takes me   minutes to eat I am testing   minutes after I am done    Thanks    Pam
1	sounds like honeymoon hell  you maybe finding it easier to control and your sensitivity gets better cause your body is kicking in that little bit extra insulin  then it quits and is hard to adjust to what being a irmal diabetic is  if that makes sense  eventually your pancreas will wear down soo much that it becomes less and less frequent but some say they have been expierencing hineymoon periods  -  years out and it seems as if the older the onset the lnger the honeymoon   my best advice is look at it like riding a wave and just do your best to stand and enjoy the ride  and keep getting back up
0	Please somebody help me to clarify this  what are the normal sugar levels  my doctor wants me to be very LOW  and the research that i have done shows different numbers doctor told me to that i have to be at Fasting less    hr after meals   is this are the normal range or my doctor is going to low  i am thinking to get a second opinion  and i failed the test for only one  point i supposed to be at   and i was at   fasting
1	I am curious  What was the   hour reading  It is the two hour reading that will tell you if your daughter has diabetes or not  You need to find out what the two hour reading  was  Second thing I noticed was that they used   grams of glucose  Usually they use   grams of glucose solution for the test  I would definitely ask why the   grams of glucose was used and what the   hour number was  If the   hour mark was   or over than she most likely has diabetes but it is hard to know since the amount of glucose used was   grams  Maybe I am wrong on that point though  Anyway  you are in a good place and will find a lot of support here  a Deaf person with Diabetes

0	Has your OB put you on a Gestational Diabetes diet  If not  ask your OB to give you one or if he or she can refer you to a dietician at the hospital  I live in Southern CA and have Kaiser Permanente  I saw the dietician and she put me on an   calorie Gestational Diabetes diet  I have to eat   times a day  Breakfast  AM snack  lunch  PM snack  dinner and PM snack) besides checking my blood sugar and exercise  The dietician told me that the time I eat my PM snack will help regulate my blood sugar  I m pretty sure she meant the fasting one)  Also  try drink a glass of water   oz ) before you test check your blood sugar  It dilutes your blood sugar -It s a trick I learned from my mom who s not only a Type   diabetic but a retired RN nurse  Hope this helps
1	Just to update this saga  the flexfix tape worked really well although junior commented  it s just like waxing  when I was peeling it off  The monitor seems to be working very nicely too  The caveat being that it s not always the same as the bg but the trend is very visible and it s very handy to have available  If its beeing going down and says   w  an arrow  I am pretty confident that I be feeling the buzz b c I am in the  s already  I have not quite reached the point where I want to not test at all but I can see that I won t need to test  x before big runs and stuff like that as much  I need to go for a long run today but am juggling it w  laundry and an eye on the weather radar and it s handy to have the stream of data for that too
1	>>I guess I might be encouraging them to do more shows with more information about diabetes rather than complaining >> You assume I complained because that s what I wrote here  but I know you get more flies with honey One thing I DID say that I felt was missing was any empathy towards the parents who have a legitimate worry about their son living on his own  and any recognition that depression  or diabetes burnout) can have a major impact on ones ability to care for oneself  and he is self medicating on top of it  This is a slight tangent  but on another Parent Message board  I see so many parents who are micro-managing their T  child s care  because that s what they believe they NEED to do) that the kids can t go anywhere unless they have a nurse with them  or the parents have sent detailed instructions  etc  It is VERY different than the way I was raised  when we had less information  but I think we are going to see MORE of this I worry about my adult child  I don t REALLY want them to leave issue  And it s too bad  because I really do believe we can do anything  Pam Diagnosed Type   at age   months  over   years now Minimed pump and cgm since July   Metformin  insulin resistance)  levothyroxine thyroid)  losartan  BP) I have traveled cross country  and to Canada  UK  Kenya  Mexico  Jamaica  Equador Galapagos islands  and lived in Egypt for a year

2	The   grams of apple sauce carbs may work if you add some food with fat protein to help slow the absorption of the carbs  like cheese  I find that if I eat just plain carbs  even if they are in the form of sugar free candy  it is not a good thing  If I combine the carbs with something fat protein  the impact on my blood glucose is slower  For example  I would never eat a potato  but I do eat potato chips with a meal  I have to be very careful and only eat one serving  usually  -  chips  I make sure that when I buy potato chips  I go only for the best just bought some jalapeno kettle cooked chips and oh my gosh are they goooooooood  Thick  flavorful and spicey  Eating baked chips is a worse idea because they don t have the fat to slow down the carbs  I bought some mini-bags of extra super movie theater butter popcorn  I can eat one bag if I plan well  Otherwise  I m stuck with a high number or have to hop on the treadmill to lower it  The small serving bags can work well to help limit my portions  With popcorn  I used to eat two full sized movie theater butter flavor and call that dinner wonder what my bg was then  argh  Too much of a good food will raise my blood glucose
0	Have you heard of Quinoa or spelt pasta   They are great substitutes for your refined flour and white rices which you should be avoiding now that you have gestational diabetes   If you make good food choices and minimize sugars and refined carbs  then you should be able to control the diabetes and have a healthy pregnancy  I am sure your doctor has spent time with you discussing good food options  but just wanted to share about the Quinoa and spelt something knew I learned in my personal quest to balance my blood sugars without medications

0	Yes  the rules have changed for gestational diabetes over the last couple of years    One of the big changes is to make the distinction clearer between type   type   and gestational diabetes   When you are first  pregnant  your doctor does an intial test to find out if you already have either type   or type    If you do  you ALREADY have one of those types of diabetes and that needed to be manages already to protect you and your baby from complications     Later on  other testing is done toward the last few months of pregnancy  and this second round of testing focuses on GD  to prevent the special risks that come in those months   The goals are tighter than they have been in the past because they narrow in on just thest last few mothes    You can read more at http  www diabetes org for-media revised-standards-of-care- html Molly  aka mollythed) Type   diabetes diagnosed in   now managed with Lantus  Humalog and Metformin  diet and exercise  My husband and three adult sons also have type   diabetes

0	Hello   Congratulations on your pregnancy    Please do not stress about the insulin  It is scary and stressful to think about but being on insulin is not a reflection of you  your health  or your ability to take care of your child  The first time I was told I had to be on insulin I was devastated  I thought I had failed  Not true  Like you  my fasting was high  Not very high  usually below   and I thought  it isn t that bad  right  But the thing is  everything is magnified when you are pregnant  so even being a little high can add risk  The nature of GD also means you have less time to experiment and figure out what works for you   There are two causes of high fasting - getting low and have a reactive high  which can be fixed by going to bed with a higher reading  or dawn phenomenon which means your body just makes more insulin in the early morning hours   That one is much harder to fix with diet or food  though you can do it in some cases  it takes a lot of experimentation   If you want to know which is causing your problem  try testing around  am for a few days   If you are getting low readings  you know it is reactive  if you are getting normal to high readings  it is DP   Either way  insulin is just a tool  If you need it  ask for a pen with the finest needle they have and it will hardly even hurt  As far as snacking in the middle of the night  the idea is to make sure you never get high readings as that is what causes the complications   So  if you eat in the middle of the night  you would not be getting a true fasting reading  but if your sugars are not spiking  I don t see why you wouldn t be able to do it   You would  however  need to wake up again after eating to test at   or   hours to make sure you are not spiking and I m not sure that would be a practical way to go about things   I believe that even diabetics who work third shift can have issues with DP  so I m not sure eating at night would fix things the way you envision    That said if your after dinner is high and you are eating before bed  you might be able to bring your fasting down by reducing those numbers  Is the chobani unsweetened  The fruit ones usually have a lot of sugar  about  g per cup  Your dinner post prandial should be under   What are you eating  Is it possible to try eating earlier in the evening or skipping the snack   Also  regardless of what the dietician told you  the only free foods are meats  Mine said the same thing but cheese has some carbs  mostly very low carb  but cottage cheese is fairly high carb at around  g per half cup) and so do veggies  Now  those types of carbs tend to have less effect on your blood sugar but it is worth understanding they exist in the event that you have trouble controlling your numbers even while eating a lot of free foods   Read labels  there are carbs in almost everythings  sometimes in very strange places   For me  things like cottage cheese worked well because I could tolerate carbs fairly well as long as they were eaten with fat and protein     You absolutely can about should snack throughout the day   This will help prevent highs and lows   Use combos of carbs and protein   Things like crackers and peanut butter or cheese  nuts  veggie sticks  etc   Check carb counts on chips  there are a few brands like Boulder Canyon veggie chips and Simply Seven lentil hummus chips that have a fairly low carb count per chip   I combine those with a protein source and try to do snacks with about  g carbs to keep me level   You may need more or less depending on how far apart your meals are  what your latest postpradial was  and how active you are during the day   It sounds counter-intuitive  but eating too few carbs can cause high levels  too  as your body tries to compensate for the low blood sugar     Hope that helps a little and feel free to ask more questions      Gestational diabetes Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz

0	Hi  I have been a very good controlled diabetic on Levemir and Novolog but since becoming pregnant I had to be changed back to NPH insulin which peaks during the day at which point I lose consciousness and the paramedics have to arrive   First when I was diagnozed as pregnant the doctors told me to take   u NPH twice a day and to have a very tight control so that after   hour my blood sugar could be no more than   I am also taking Novolog   I was taken to the hospital twice this week due to the NPH peaking  and at this point I don t know what to do  I feel that the doctors are experimenting on me  now I am told to take   units of NPH in the morning    units at lunch and   units at bedtime   I feel the   units at bedtime is still too high  and I would feel more comfortable with   or    Anyone else had problems on NPH   I am a type   diabetic  now pregnant
1	What are the hardest parts for you   What do you skip over when you are under pressure   Do you keep your meter with you all the time   How about insulin so you are free to snack at unexpected times   Emergency food in case you miss a meal     Or is it really just the constantness of being responsible for yourself coupled with the freedom to not have other people second-guessing what you do    Just like you need to have an emergency plan for getting out of your home or dorm in case of fire  it pays to have a backup plan for all the things that can so easilyl go wrong on a daily basis  like have supplies with you always in you backpack or whatever   Dealing with the whole business of balancing freedom and responsibility is a big deal for everybody in college   It s the time of your life when you have to take on those issues  and it is  in the long run  maybe more important than what you lear in class or studying   You need to be ready to forgive yourself when you don t meet up to your OWN expectations  but then start fresh  not just to please others  but because you care about yourself   It doesn t just happen automatically  because you want it to   It does still take time and practice   It can be easier or harder  depending on what kind of a relationship you had with your parents     The hard part about diabetes is that the consequences of getting it wrong can be so much more serious  while at the same time  thedrive to be yourself  without other people putting their own expectations on you  can be so much stronger because you have had more responsibilty heaped on you at a younger age    Or have I got it wrong  Molly  aka mollythed) Type   diabetes diagnosed in   now managed with Lantus  Humalog and Metformin  diet and exercise  My husband and three adult sons also have type   diabetes

2	Hi    I had my  -month follow-up last Thurs after being diagnosed T  in Dec    When diagnosed  my A c was    Last Thursday it was    In Dec  my triglycerides were literally off scale  now down to    Still some work to do on cholesteral  but huge improvement there as well   I ve also dropped quite a bit of weight - still have more to go  but making progress    Did it with exercise  diet and meds   Can t say for sure which elements were most important  but I believe diet and exercise were more of a factor than the meds - at least for the blood glucose   I base that on bg being   at diagnosis   It took about a week to get lab results and prescriptions sorted out and my fbg had dropped to   before I started any meds - didn t have a meter for most of that time so all I have is the two data points w o meds - at diagnosis and fbg the morning I started the meds    Here s a summary in case it s useful to anyone    Exercise  Mostly walking   I had been pretty much a couch potato and started walking  typically  -  miles a day almost every day  the dog was quick to sign on for helping with that)   On days when snow or other weather made going outside impractical  I did stair reps - up stairs  down stairs  walk around the room  repeat for  -  reps   Added some of the simple stuff during the day - stairs instead of elevator  take the long way to the coffee pot at work  get up and stretch or take a short walkabout around the office  basically look for ways to move more  Most evenings - push ups and crunches    Diet   Cut way back on carbs - at diabetes class  the dietician gave me a starting point for a meal plan of   g breakfast    g am snack    g lunch    g pm snack    g supper   I ususally eat a little less than that  but it seemed pretty close - I realize that s quite a bit more carbs than many here eat and it wouldn t work for everyone  it s just what I did   I used to skip breakfast most days  then eat a big lunch   That s changed along with what I eat - a lot less bread  pasta and snack foods  more salads and non-starchy veggies   A typical day will go something like   Breakfast - instant sugar free oatmeal  half a grapefruit  glass of low-fat milk   AM snack - a banana   Lunch - varies  but maybe a salad  small roll  and a piece of fruit   PM snack - peanuts  you get a good sized pile of peanuts for   g of carb)   Supper - about the same stuff as before  but much smaller portions of carby stuff and more veggies   Very little change in drinks  I didn t don t drink much sugary stuff  mostly water and coffee   I am drinking more milk than before  but that s only because I very rarely had milk before being diagnosed   I have cut back on wine with dinner  still have an occaisional glass  but less frequently and only one glass when I do have one  Found some good recipes in the Eating Right board  including Marty s Orange Sour Cream Cakes - first time in my   years on the planet for zesting an orange    Meds   Metformin  mg   twice a day  Glipizide  started at   mg twice a day  mid-Jan changed to   mg ext release once a day  last appointment changed to   mg ext rel once a day  Fenofibrate    mg  once a day to control cholesterol  Lisinonpril    mg once a day to protect my kidneys    That s it   No magic potion  just exercise  diet and common diabetes meds along with some prayer and support from my family    Many thanks to the community here   These boards have been a very valuable resource for learning more about the disease and steps to control it   Particularly in the days right after being diagnosed when I was trying to get started  but didn t even know the vocabulary    Best  Russ
0	Most of the time  the main cause of Gestational diabetes os overweight  If you keep your blood glucose level in control then you can also keep contrl on your GD  Weight loss with the help of diet and exercise is the best and natural way to control blood glucose level or GD
0	If by reverse  you mean nothing more than manage diabetes with careful eating and exercise  then yes  it is sometimes possible for some women to manage blood glucose level during pregnancy without any medication  but if you are trying to say that the diabetes is gone  and not just well-controlled  and that there is no genetic basis for the problem  you are in a very small minority  and your view is not supported by the best experts    Women with gestational diabetes  and people in general with type   diabetes  are not able to process carbohydrate as well as those who don t have diabetes  Depending on exactly what flaws they have in metabolism  they may be able to compensate for the problem  and get along with lower blood glucose and fewer chances for complications for themselves and their babies   Sometimes that may require insulin or other medication  but sometimes the problem can be controlled by carefully chosing a diet with fewer carbs or exercising to improve their body s ability to use insulin  With a serious effort  they can acheive blood glucose levels that people with normal metabolism acheive without giving it any thought at all    After pregnancy  those women who had gestational diabetes because of small defects may be able to once again get along with reasonable blood glucose levels   Their bodies may function normally without the extra stress of pregnancy   For many of them  though  the signs of diabetes will eventually return   because it was never really gone  just hidden until age and other stresses once again make the underlying problems show up  Molly  aka mollythed) Type   diabetes diagnosed in   now managed with Lantus  Humalog and Metformin  diet and exercise  My husband and three adult sons also have type   diabetes

0	Good morning     Many women who are diagnosed with GD as well as people with Type   do in fact reverse their condition without medication the problem is many people do not get the right support from their doctor   Learning to eat healthy requires more than just looking online as there is a lot of misinformation out there    To say you cannot reverse diabetes is incorrect   Many people are unsucessful at reversing diabetes because they do not have the proper guidance  or choose to rely on medications but there are also many people who ARE successful   There are too many studies out there that PROVE  GD and Type   CAN BE REVERSED  through diet alone    If  my doctor told me I could not reverse diabetes I would start looking for a new doctor who is aware of the studies and who is motivated to help their patient to make changes through diet    Most doctors do not have the resources so you may need to seek out a nutritionist or health coach to guide you WEEKLY   Attending a group meeting that gives you a brief overview of good food vs bad food does not work for many people unfortunately       Donna

0	You can try posting on the type   forum and you ll get more responses  You ll need to take into consideration that being pregnant means you need to handle certain things more carefully but there are some very smart and experienced folks over there  Have you seen a nutritionist at all  I would suggest staying away from cereal completely and sticking with green veggies  meat  cheese  nuts  and small portions of whole grain carbs  Milk is very high carb  Try unsweetened almond milk instead  Meals consisting on lots of carbs and very little protein will also spike you higher and faster than high protein and low to moderate carb meals  You should also be eating every three - four hours to help minimize spikes  Simple carbs  like your cereal  and liquid carbs  like the milk  also spike quickly and then will rapidly drop  So it is not surprising that you had that big of a swing in three and a half hours  You ate more carbs with very little protein on top of that    is still normal  btw  As far as I know  glyburide will not work as a reactive drug  you take it regularly to help keep your bg at consistent levels not when you get high)  Tomorrow try an omelet for breakfast instead and see how that works  Also are your fasting numbers within limits and are you eating as soon as you wake up  Gestational diabetes Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz

0	Well  if your numbers during the day were consistently  -  points above your target then your doctor wouldwant you to be on insulin for that too  It is not even that it is more important  it is that it is not under control and control is critical  I did insulin shots with both my pregnancies because I preferred the way insulin worked over glyburide  The shots are not bad at all  Have you been warned that since you were diagnosed so early you are much more likely to have type   and not gestational diabetes  Gestational diabetes Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz

1	Thanks  Trisha i have dexcom   shows   minute readings  lag time as well  but it is very  very accurate  I can feel my blood sugars rising before the dexcom shows the rise  and yes  double arrows up  rising very quickly) after i eat  I m hardly eating  for lunch    days in a row    skinless grilled chicken breast    c  steamed broccoli    c  s free pudding  started lunch at   within that   minutes i m over   i prebolus and am bolusing for protein  IDK  I can feel this  every rise and fall and I start to sweat  ya know  I started back on POD and may go back to Revel pump  in hopes of trying to find something that won t spike me so much when I eat and allow me to eat more and gain some weight   Maybe I ll try Apidra or humalog again  novolog not working)  maybe my basal isn t correct yet IDK   Just feel exhausted all the time    Thanks

2	Thanks for stepping in  This isn t the first time that a conversation has turned into an immature political debate  which is why I refrain from posting as frequently as I did when I first joined  it smacks of elitism and leaves others feeling unwelcome)  Everyone here has a story to tell and a unique perspective to offer  which is why this forum is so invaluable  however  it disturbs me when a contributor becomes insulting  i e  labeling someone s opinion as uneducated is nothing short of name calling)  The bottom line is that everyone has different experiences with this disease  including care-- just because something works for you  doesn t mean that it works for others or that others do not fall between the cracks  It is  therefore  extremely important that comments retain a respectful tone because the political in this case is  without a doubt  personal  If we can t agree to disagree with grace  then it is perhaps best to withhold our tongue
0	Hi  I m pregnant with my second baby and was diagnosed with GD last month  April   ) after taking my  nd  -hour GTT  Half of the blood sugar values were high)  Both my mom and dad are Type   diabetics  I m also an older mom  I m   years old  I also found out from my research that my ethnic group put me at risk for GD  I m Asian-American) -Something that neither my midwife or OB told me  Also  I found out from the latter that there are other minority groups at risk of developing GD  African-American  Native American and Hispanic American)  If your OB or dietician has given you a GD diet do follow it now  test check your blood sugar and exercise  You don t have to develop Type   diabetes after your pregnancy -It s really up to you  Just eat healthy and exercise and you ll beat those odds

0	Hi  Last week I failed my   hour glucose test with a      I am currently   weeks pregnant with twins   My OB had me begin testing   times a day  fasting  and   hours post meals) and set me up for an appointment a week later to discuss results   However  he didn t give me any good information or a real plan on what I was supposed to do for the week   They did give me an information packet and told me I could find good information on this website to tell me what to do   Basically  I am wondering where I can get good  clear instruction on how to balance my carbs  proteins  fats   And eat enough for both my babies   The packet i was given had really contradictory information saying to avoid eggs and nuts and then later nuts and eggs were in the examples of what to eat   I thought it was really confusing information    My OB didn t  say anything about seeing a dietician is there somewhere with clear guidelines    Also  my levels haven t been incredibly high  only over   one time in the past   days but fasting they have been  -  for   of the   mornings      With multiples  I am already at high risk for Preeclampsia so this worries me   Does anybody know statistics for how likely you are to have Preeclampsia Eclampsia when you have GD    Thanks for your time  Nicole
1	acidrock   ) I think that the data is  skewing  my approach  CGM=  but then I check my BG and it s like   so I eat something  then it flies up in the  s so I correct and up and down a lot more than usual  Maybe I should just not look at it or something  I think also that my I C ratio is too low  I have thought that for a while but always felt I needed data to confirm this  I have always done a lot of  eat   bolus for  G  of carbs and it seems like that it would be more useful to be more precise  If the CGM gets me to fix that  it may still prove to be useful  Was it really   when you corrected though  When I had the Navigator  I was able to trust that when it said I was   I really was around   give or take a couple points  You probably just need to try and look at what it is telling you  Does the Minimed have the directional arrows like the Navigator   Dex do  Those arrows really helped to know what was happening  Usually for me  when I take some insulin to bring a high down  it takes awhile to kick in  I could at least see at what point my BS stopped going straight up  But it can get pretty daunting when you take insulin and see those arrows keep going straight up  Try   figure out how long it takes for the arrows to slow down and eventually turn around  It will help you be able to be more aggressive but at the same time  you need to have some patience to give your insulin a chance to work  Kelly www kellywpa wordpress com Type   Diagnosed January    Dexcom Seven Plus CGMS Pumping With Animas PIng   Apidra Since June
0	I think the idea is that if your number is still high in the morning  it has probably been a lot higher all night long  ever since supper the night before   Of course  that does t really make a lot of sense for women whose blood glucose really stays fine all night  but then rises in the morning when their bodies start to wake up  but with GD  the doctors don t want to mess around figuring that out   a reading of   during the day is probably just a short-term peak  ready to drop on its own without intervention    Another factor is that if you start out with blood glucose high in the morning  you can be fighting it all day long     It may help to keep in mind that insulin is not a punishment for less than perfect behavior   It is a tool to make life easier   Many people feel like they could never learn to give themselves injections   It s funny how that attitude can disappear after just giving themselves a couple of shots and finding out how relatively easy and painless it really is  Molly  aka mollythed) Type   diabetes diagnosed in   now managed with Lantus  Humalog and Metformin  diet and exercise  My husband and three adult sons also have type   diabetes

0	You don t have to tell anyone and while people can think whatever they want  it is most certainly not your fault  Gd is caused by hormones from the placenta  The hardest part of gd is how people always think pregnant women should be stuffing their faces with junk As for food  count all your carbs not just sugar  Wholegrain bread  an apple  and a piece of cake can all have the same effect on you and testing is the only way to know what that is  Balance carbs with fat and protein to help spikes  Most likely your nutritionst will recommend  -  carbs per snack meal and  -  meals per day  Testing will tell you your personal tolerance  I know the time between diagnosis and education is terrible but you are still fairly early in your pregnancy so try not to stress too much  Do ask your doctor about your increased risk for other issues such as pre eclampsia however most mama s with gd have no issues related to it  I was on insulin with both boys and had to be monitored twice weekly and they were the most boring appts ever the only advice I can give for testing us to not flinch  Good luck and congratulations  Gestational diabetes Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz

2	Reyna Brock  ) Losing weight-on the other hand  why cant i just not eat for a day and lose   pounds   yes lol I ve cried already that I haven t lost a significant amount of weight in two weeks but i lost   pounds  The reason you don t want to skip eating  your liver will release glucose and actually cause your BG to spike  The trick is to eat small controlled amounts every   or   hours to keep that from occurring and keep your BG stable  I ve found that simply cutting way back on the carbs since I ve been diagnosed as resulted in weight loss  Nothing fast and earth shattering  but enough for people to notice  The big trick  it s happening in a sustainable manner  not some quick fix diet that can t be maintained for a lifetime  So IMO  don t worry about dropping a lot of weight fast  but be happy about dropping every little bit you drop in a manner you can sustain for a lifetime

0	Donna  I realize that you mean well  but medication is not the enemy  I ate well during my first pregnancy the whole time  Not low carb by any means  but healthy for a non diabetic  I had to take a very small amount of insulin at night to control my fasting even after adjusting my diey because there is virtually no time during pregnancy to mess around with figuring out hiw to bring that down  The second time I followed a diabetic diet my whole pregnancy  exercised several times a week and actually lost weight overall  I had to use four times as much insulin to keep my fasting down  Pregnant women are extremely emotional and vulnerable about this because it threatens our children  Using words like reverse implies that a woman just wasn t trying hard enough because if she was it would be gone and that just is not true  I rarely had readings over   and almost never over   but I was still high risk  It broke my heart when I had to go on insulin with my first because I felt I had failed  And whether you mean to or not  making statements about being to quick to jump to medicine reinforces that feeling  But I would do it again in a heartbeat because my children were born healthy  To the op  I hope you are feeling better  If you are still confused  the type   board has lots of general info that is pertinent  Gestational diabetes Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz

1	I just started my insulin pump on Monday and I have changed it   times my question is does the pump affect your eating habits  the reason I m asking is because when I changed my site on Wednesday I didn t have an appetite which caused me to have lows partically half the day  I still don t have to much of an appetite  it comes and goes)  I am getting my appetite back slowly but not to the fullest  yesterday I only ate breakfast and when I checked my BG it was around   and I m wondering how can it be high if all I was doing is drinking water  I bought some Boost Glucose Control to drink to replace what I was getting from not eating  does the pump affect your eating habits  I am on the Animas Pump using Novolog with my machine please help if you can  thank you in advance

0	Well  you were right about the meds  Friday I was subbing for a high school class and started feeling bad   Then I started sweating like I was cutting grass   I was in a cold  air conditioned room   It was getting hard to speak   I knew then I was going hypoglycemic     Fortunately I had my lunch with me  and was able to get other foods to try to right this wrong   But because I didn t have a glucose meter I have no idea what my blood sugar fell to   I called my OBGYN s office and she told me to get off the meds immediately and I am supposed to go through the round of glucose testing again tomorrow    I didn t want to make a fuss  but I thought it was really strange that she would prescribe diabetes medication without seeing how a good  clear diet and an exercise program would work first   If that didn t work  then move to more intensive therapies   She has told me to stay on the diet  and I am more than willing to do that     Also I asked about getting a meter to check my blood sugar  especially since I was being put on medication to lower blood sugar) and she completely blew that off in favor of testing at the hospital once a week   Well too bad lady   I got one of those ReliON glucose meters and I can t tell you how much better I feel that I can check my sugar myself    I am going to see if she will let me control GD with exercise and diet without meds or insulin unless my numbers are proving to need more treatment   If she wants to put me back on that Glyburide  then I will see if she will let me do a half pill instead

0	The no family history thing can be misleading   Gestational diabetes is closely tied to type   diabetes  which can come on slowly and go undetected for many years   The stresses of pregnancy can be a hint of what is likely to happen again later as a person ages   Many people think that they have no family history of type   diabetes because grandparents or great-grandparents or great aunts and uncles died of other causes  like heart attacks  strokes  or kidney failure that were really complications of undiagnosed type   diabetes  There are things we all can do to reduce our chances of diabetes  like maintaining a normal  weight  and staying physically active  and they may work for years  or maybe a lifetime  but they may not  will not  be enough to overcome the genes that predispose us to diabetes  and they will not work for everyone  It doesn t pay to fret about that once diabetes shows up   We need to put our energy into dealing with diabetes  and feeling guilty that we let it happen is misguided and a waste of our energy  both for you and your daughter   Sometimes bad things do happen to good people   The focus now is on managing it  and the wonderful thing about gestational diabetes is that there is such a great payoff for the effort it takes  Molly  aka mollythed) Type   diabetes diagnosed in   now managed with Lantus  Humalog and Metformin  diet and exercise  My husband and three adult sons also have type   diabetes
2	Joyabba  You are in the US currently  right  As much as I  and many others) complain  the US government does provide pretty good benefits  including excellent insurance  to employees  It can still be pretty spendy  and you don t make a ton of money  but you can usually make it work  You can also get in a group life insurance plan if you make sure to sign up right away on hiring  There are some issues  First  you almost always need to work in at least a mid-sized metro area  and a vast majority of federal jobs are centered in a few major cities  Because the job market still sucks  there s been a huge influx of applicants for government positions  so the process is always extremely competitive  And  well  there s all the you work for the government pitfalls  Still  if it s something that can work for you  it might be worth looking into  There are a lot of positions for accountants and admin types  depending on where you look  As to the rest  I  too  have been showing ID for years now when receiving health care  I understood that all responsible providers had been doing this for a while due to health care related ID theft problems  The biggest concern here is that people are getting injured or killed because their records are messed up by the ID fraud  It can also be really hard to get straightened out because of HIPPA and other industry rules and regs  I ve pretty much said what I have to say on the whole health care debate  To me  it comes down to those   annual deaths in the study I cited earlier in the thread  NO country with   annual deaths attributable to lack of access can legitimately claim to have the best health care in the world  In fact  I would argue that isn t even very good care  Also  the part of the debate that always seems to get lost is just how wasteful our system is now  Currently  we pay huge amounts of money to fund care for the uninsured and underinsured  It s done through subsidies  primarily to hospital ERs and urgent care clinics  Those who cannot afford care only seek treatment when their conditions are very advanced  thus much more expensive to treat  and are forced to seek care through the most expensive mechanisms in our health care system  because that s the only access to care that they have  In addition  people who were dropped by their insurer or getting sick  denied covered treatment  or denied insurance were typically bankrupted  then covered through medicaid SSI  Again  already paying for these people  The main effects that seem likely from this reform are   to make the system less destructive to people who get sick  and   to move the normal practice of care back to more normal  and less expensive  methods

0	Okay  do you eat breakfast right after you wake up  Many people have dawn phenomenon which will cause your blood glucose to continue to rise until you eat  If you really want to know what is going on for your fasting   which is way high and the one number your doctor will probably be most concerned about) try testing at  am a couple of times  If you are high at that point it is Dp and there isn t a whole lot you can do aside from medicine although some people do have luck with exercise and a bedtime snack  If you are low then you are rebounding  not enough carbs can also cause high by) and having a higher carb bedtime snack could help  If you get your fasting down it will help your breakfast since you aren t super high for onetime hour post  Remember your readings build on each other so you could be eating okay but if your pre meal numbers are high then your post meal will be high as well Since your dinner is so high but you don t appear to be eating a lot of carbs maybe try testing before you eat to see if you are starting out high  I could never have handled that many carbs for snacks  I usually aimed for   to   and ate nuts  cheese  and maybe a partial serving of some veggie chips  Since you have two before dinner I suspect it is the snack and not the meal spiking you  I ate a lot of veggies and salads  Also there is a product called dreamfields pasta that has some kind of coating that prevents carb absorption  fresh pastas  made of soy  in produce by the tofu and vegan products) that are low carb and cauliflower mashed potatoes  and fried rice   There is a recipe forum on here and I used to get good info from the type two forum for more ideas Also if you don t exercise that can help with overall control  Oh  and congratulations on your baby  Gestational diabetes Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz

0	Hi I am sorry to hear you are having difficulty  Keep in mind that insulin is not bad  having high numbers is so don t feel bad if you need meds  I had to take insulin at night with both my pregnancies to control fasting  That said  you can certainly do a lot with diet  What numbers are you getting  when are you testing and what are you eating  Have you met with a dietician or can you  All carbs count in a diabetic diet so make sure you are counting bread  starches  sauces and dressings  potatoes  milk  and veggies like peas and corn  not just sugar  Eating whole grain carbs with fat and or protein will help to slow the absorption of carbs which prevents spikes  Also you should be eating several small meals and spreading out your carbs over the day  Many people tolerate carbs better in the evenings than the morning  Test and see what works for you  Also keep in mind that you tolerance for carbs will get increasingly worse especially from   to   weeks so you need to keep adjusting  Hope that helps a little  Gestational diabetes Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz
2	dinycat  ) Nobody in the United States is being denied access to healthcare  Just look at our Emergency Rooms  There are signs all over stating that fact  and I truly believe there is no difference in the care received  Matter of fact  we give our indigent enough money that they don t have to work  and can spend it in Las Vegas  Hawaii  and on cruise ships   See current news headlines ) As far as the Canadian health program  why is it that people like Peter Jennings and the Labrador minister  Danny Williams  come to the U S  for treatment  Honestly  I m really not trying to be fomenting or argumentative  I like Canada  my mother was born in Saskatchewan  But you really shouldn t tout your country and healthcare too much  or you just might experience a mass exodus from the south--and then you ll be in the same boat we are  Bleeding Cubbie blue  dinycat I don t think going to the ER for regular care for diabetes is really an option  Private policies that are unaffordable  employers no longer offering insurance  how many employed people like myself that worked full-time but do not have insurance  I personally do not think that is access to health care  Just for example  there are too many women who show up at the ER in labor and never saw a doctor once during the entire pregnancy  This is not what I consider reasonable access to health care  The ER is for emergencies  not regular care

2	It doesn t surprise me that there are some people out there who are misanthropic enough to consign other people to lousy healthcare  What DOES surprise me is that any of those misanthropic people have chronic illnesses like diabetes  Here s my Modest Proposal  If we are trying to be as efficient as possible with our funds  then by all means  let s not only return diabetes to being a pre-existing condition  but let s make sure that all diabetes supplies are paid for out of pocket  Once the people with chronic illnesses die at an early age due to unaffordable health care and no coverage for chronic illness supplies  the pool of healthy individuals will be even larger  and we as a country won t have to pay so much for health care  Someone brought up the question of illegal immigrants  Yes  let s make sure that they have no access to health care  even in our emergency rooms  It can be like Haiti  where unless you can pay cash for your health care  you don t get seen  Not only that  but you have to go down to hawkers in front of the hospital and pay for your own catheters  syringes  blood transfusion bags  etc  and bring them to the OR before anyone will do an operation  even in an emergency  And I don t see why we should vaccinate the children of illegal immigrants  just because that helps us to avoid epidemics  If epidemics knock out a few of those kids of the crunchy granola non-vaccinating families while they are at it  more to the good  right  There s always more than one way to bring health care costs down

0	I too am frustrated that you were not given the proper guidance   I have been visiting OB Doc offices to share with them how I want to help women just like you and their response has been we refer patients  out to the classes at the hospital yet when I ask more details about how that plan is working for their patients  or if they see any improvement  the doctor s office does not know   How can that be   Just referring out is not the solution   Getting an orientation with a list of foods to take home with you may work for some people but most people need more support     Try looking for a certified health coach in your area   They are just as qualified as a Registered Dietician and they can help you with the support you need   Health coaches also go beyond just diet and look at lifestyle issues   Things like stress can also affect your blood sugars  or if you tend to eat the wrong foods when stressed that can also hurt your efforts to eat healthier    hang in there    Donna

1	I think that the data is  skewing  my approach  CGM=  but then I check my BG and it s like   so I eat something  then it flies up in the  s so I correct and up and down a lot more than usual  Maybe I should just not look at it or something  I think also that my I C ratio is too low  I have thought that for a while but always felt I needed data to confirm this  I have always done a lot of  eat   bolus for  G  of carbs and it seems like that it would be more useful to be more precise  If the CGM gets me to fix that  it may still prove to be useful  My problem yesterday was that  ) I woke up high  likely due to overeating after the race    was not totally depressing  but not good ) but I wanted to stick the sensor in anyway so I didn t correct it  figuring a couple more hours wouldn t be that big of a deal  Unfortunately  despite no  inputs  my BG rose to   by calibration time so I immediately corrected it  cranked basal up to    damn the torpedoes )  and  bolused for food  figuring I d wait until it came down a bit to eat but it didn t come down  hanging out >   all morning which had me in a complete snit  So    lunchtime  I bolused again and  while it came down  small carb inputs seemed to hit more than their  s  I was overbolusing some more just to be on the  safe  side) kick it back to  s so I corrected a bunch and it was just waaaay more stressful than I ever recall running into w o the CGM  Last evening was smoother and the line was straight across all night  although still off a shade as it said   and my meter said   but those are both within the margins of error  After thinking about the running up  I will see if I can work it better w  more bolusing with an eye on turning down my basal a shade too

0	When blood glucose begins to go too high  there are two possibilities   One is that the number will not come down to a normal level overnight  and you will have what is called impaired fasting glucose  The other is that your body does catch up over night but then it is unable to process glucose meal by meal so glucose numbers continue to rise over the course of the day and need the overnight period to get caught up  That s called impaired glucose tolerance    What we call type   diabetes  or gestational diabetes when it comes in the later months of pregnancy  isn t necessarily just one disease   There are lots of little details that can go wrong in the process of turning carbohydrates into glucose aand using it for energy  It seems as though as we learn more about diabetes  it becomes clear that it is really a collection of different diseases  For you  it seems that your problem just happens to be impaired glucose tolerance instead of impaired fasting glucose    I hope your visit with the OB GYN today goes well and that you leave with more information and fewer worries  Doctors will be more cautious with someone who has high glucose  and they will do everything they can to help you get through the next months with well-managed blood glucose to help keep your baby safe  There may be extra doctor visits toward the end of pregancy to keep track of what is going on  but most of the work will be up to you  day by day  as you take care of yourself and as you figure out how to eat  and use insulin if necessary  to keep your baby healthy  There will be plenty of home blood glucose testing to let you know that you are on track     Meanwhile  you should know that having diabetes is not your fault  They tell us that is it a progressive disease  in the sense that the older we get  the harder it is for our bodies to accomplish what they need to do   You may have tried harder to do everything right this time   The test results don t mean that you failed  What if you had not tried  Things could be worse right now  You will have extra help from here on out and things will get better    I was never diagnosed with gestational diabetes  I did have one miscarriage  I did have two babies over nine pounds   I have a feeling that with current diagnostic criteria  I would have been diagnosed with GD back then  forty years ago  but things still went well  I m hoping that some of the other women who have had GD will come along and tell you about their experiences and how they managed    My best wishes to you  Molly  aka mollythed) Type   diabetes diagnosed in   now managed with Lantus  Humalog and Metformin  diet and exercise  My husband and three adult sons also have type   diabetes

2	Hi Rodney    The thirst and peeing is related to your high bg readings    What bg levels were you running in the month before this started    Did you start a new pen of insulin around the time you started experiencing the symptoms    If so I would try a new pen batch in case you got a defective dose of meds     If you haven t changed anything else in what you have been doing or eating in that time frame then something isn t working right   Two weeks is more then enough time to give your body time to settle back to your norms or get over a bump    A sudden change for an experienced diabetic  from being in control to a couple of weeks at  ish qualifies for an ER visit to get it down to normal ranges and figure out what is going on        Rob Rob - Type   since   Toronto  Canada

2	i just started walking again after a  -  year hiatus  Now my legs are retaining water  I can t figure this out  I m on metformin the lowest dose  Do you think that has something to do with it  Because I have never had this before when I was on diet and exercise only prior to my hiatus  I ve never heard of any instances of metformin causing water retention   Something that I have heard of is that allowing yourself to become dehydrated can cause your body to retain fluid  to conserve it more or less   It s important to make sure you don t become dehydrated with metformin as it can change the acid balance of your system  Here s a link that explains metformin further   click here Lizzy Knowledge is Power  Here s some useful links  click on the titles Testing      All About Carbs Resources For The Un-insured and Discount Medicine and Equipment LizzyLou Videos Lizzy s Blog for lots more

1	Dear All  I want to address to you with the following request  I have   type of diabetes  I am   years  I have diabetes for   years and I have a problem of availability of insulin for injections  I live in Ukraine  the insulin was given to us by the government  but for the last five months the hospitals don t have it due to the political and economic situation in the country  I am struggling hardly to survive as I have a wife student and a   years old child  For me the price of insulin is not affordable I became the hostage of the situation and I see no other choice but to ask for help  I DON T ASK FOR MONEY  I ASK FOR INSULIN  Perhaps you have insulin at the end of term  or even delayed  and you no longer need it  For me it s a matter of survival  I need such types of insulin   Novorapid and Levimir by NovoNordisk  Denmark  or their analogs  ultra-short  or ultra-rapid   and extended)  Kind Regards ================ Artem Yurov  Contact information has been removed because solicitation is not allowed under our Terms of Use   Forum Moderator  ]

0	good morning    First of all it is quite normal to be panicking right now   There are many concerns with having GD but the good news is you CAN manage it and reverse it will the right changes in your diet     I am glad to hear your doctor has set up an appointment with a nutritionist   Take advantage of their help and make sure they sit down with you and give you a plan to follow to help you replace the bad carbs  breads  pastas  sweets etc) with healthier foods    Unfortunately when we are pregnant we think this is the time to eat whatever we want   But GD does not happen just to women who eat junk food   I know of a woman from Italy   who would make fresh  homemade pasta and other Italian dishes  only to find out she had GD during her pregnancy     Another reason to try not to stress out right now is stress can actually affect your blood sugar levels   Try doing things that will hlep you relax   deep breathing  listening to music  simple yoga for pregnant women  etc    I wish you the best of luck and you CAN reverse your GD    Donna
1	Thanks for the tips Mary  oddly enough  it seems to be working flawlessly today  I still am off running again until tomorrow but I lifted weights  was perhaps lower than I d liked to have been   the start of it but was able to check regularly and didn t seem to get wiggy  It also didn t beep so I have no idea where that came from  Neither did MiniMed  They were like  set it on  vibrate  which it was  I will keep at it but have my eye on the   day clock too  If I keep blowing up sensors it will probably only last   weeks  tomorrow I ll try the new tape and see how that goes when I swap it out
1	Andy  The boy in question is actually a middle schooler  th   th     th grades -- as opposed to the jr highs we had when we were kids and which had only  th    th grades in them) and as such makes multiple class changes everyday  The school was allowing him not only walking club time  but time out of homeroom  early dismissal from each class so he can take a long route to his next class  and or access to intramural sports  So  it s not as if the school district was denying him access to physical activity  Shoot  he has more chances at physical activity than my neighbor s kid  and she REALLY needs it  I put in her estimated height and weight into a kid BMI chart  and she is in the  th percentile  i e  without a doubt  obese for her age  height  and weight  And this is a kid with type   dm on both sides of her family)  She has only one day per week during which she receives physical education  While she does participate in intramural basketball during the basketball season  that is only for a few weeks during the winter  The rest of the year well  let s just say that she is not the most active kid  She could barely wash two dishes before she had to sit down and rest for   minutes  Why the lack of phys ed in school  Well  you can  at least partially  blame Ted Kennedy -- who helped author the No Child Left Behind  NCLB) bill -- and George Bush -- who encouraged this high-stakes testing nightmare and signed NCLB into law -- for this pathetic state  Sure  you can also blame parents  who keep their children indoors and in front of the Nintendo when there s even a chance of rain  or the media  who have instilled a culture of raving fear into the American populace  leading parents to not allow their children out-of-doors  oh  and to believe that games like dodgeball are evil)  or the tanking economy  for forcing both parents to work and not allowing one to stay at home so the kids are monitored and for cutting the funding base  school taxes) from which most districts obtain a chunk of their incomes  Blame it on whatever  but the fact remains that in many school districts in the US  physical education  music  and art classes have been hit particularly hard  sometimes to the point where some districts have had to cut them completely  Teachers  principals  and superintendents will tell you that in order to get students ready for the standardized tests which NCLB requires  you MUST cut out something  Considering the tests will not ask you to do   jumping jacks or show you can do   pull ups  but will ask you to define words  solve math problems  and demonstrate historical and scientific literacy  most districts want to focus more time on more academic areas than on non-academic areas  I can see you question the purpose of music and reading skills classes and value physical education over either of these  especially in these days of increasing childhood obesity  While I was not a fan of gym class when I was in school  I certainly see the value of it and find it appalling that gym classes have been cut  However  both music and reading skills classes have their place within an educational curriculum  I want to address these issues one at a time  Music can teach children a great deal besides introducing them to a way to make noise  In addition to teaching rhythm and tempo  which are important to many physical activities  think about dribbling a basketball and how  to control it well  the ball needs to be slapped evenly -- in rhythm)  music leads to dancing -- a physical activity  You can learn math concepts during music  Think about   time  whole notes  and eighth note rests  Physics is also represented in music -- consider that music is sound waves  right  History  literature  religion and art can all be discussed within music classes  I m thinking of the folk songs Erie Canal  Swing Low  Sweet Chariot  and even Amazing Grace  just to name a few songs from American history that have had an impact on our culture  There is more to music than simply making noise  though that s fun  too)  I am certain you think that by sixth grade  children should be able to read well enough that they no longer need special reading instruction classes  I know I didn t  but I was reading before I started kindergarten and I don t remember a time when I couldn t read and read fairly fluently  However  not all children are able to pick up on the act of reading as well as I could  There are children who can decode words well  that is  use phonics)  but when asked to read a passage  comprehend it  then use it to make a point  are unable to do so  Darn  I spent over   minutes trying to find that reference in my files and I can t  GRR )  While I don t fully believe some of the stuff taught in graduate schools of education around the country  I do believe that comprehension is a higher-order cognitive activity that needs far more practice and work to develop than does decoding  The purpose of reading skills classes for upper elementary and early middle school children is to help children more fully develop their skill at comprehension and  for lack of a better term) use of textual materials  This is extremely important in more ways than one  Consider the way some doctors disseminate information  They hand you a pamphlet about your disorder  I remember about   years ago  I went to my doctor  got the usual blood work  which revealed that my cholesterol was high  my A c was starting to climb  too  but it wasn t high enough to alert my doctor to change anything)  His office staff mailed a pamphlet to me to read about low-fat diets  Think about what has to be done with that pamphlet  You have to decode all of the words  understand not just the individual words  but the words in the context  place some meaning around what you have understood  e g  Getting this pamphlet indicates that I am getting older and am likely to have a heart attack )  then take some action  e g  start a low-fat diet)  This is no easy feat for many people  and is why many medical pamphlets look like comic books  which I find insulting  and wish they d make two sets of pamphlets  One for the masses and one for those of us who are much brighter)  If you are unable to make the leap from simple sound-out-the-words to understanding and appropriate action  then no amount of comic books are going to help you make those changes  Because more of our communication is taking place via the written word  ahem )  ensuring the future generation is able to understand the written  and spoken) word is very important  Therefore  I would argue that the reading skills class is extraordinarily important to this young man  or at least as important as gym class  Of course  there is something to the idea that if teachers integrated reading and comprehension skills into science  math  social studies  etc  at an earlier age  then there would be no reason to have a reading skills course after   years of education  Students would have gotten these skills through the years while at the same time learning to read for a purpose  something even adults have a problem doing)  I hope I didn t bore you too much  Andy  This is one of my areas  so to speak  Angela

0	I was told that the major risk factor to getting gd is family history  Both my maternal and paternal grandfathers had type   and my mother had gd while pregnant with me   I had gd with my first son and will most likely get it again this time around   Weight is also an issue   I am borderline obese   and about  - lbs) which doesn t help any  but with my history  I would have been more likely to get the gd anyway   If you are asking about the risk factors once you have gd - a more likely chance of you and your child being diagnosed with diabetes down the road  overweight child at birth which can lead to c-section  eclampsia    The important thing is to not feel guilty and know you are in control   This is not easy - I had to use insulin at night to control my fasting numbers with my son and when the doctor told me that  I sat in my car for about   minutes and just cried   I felt like I had failed my child   But I managed to keep the rest of my number well under control through diet and exercise   Make sure you are testing at all the times your doctor tells you to  keep a food diary so you can see what causes spikes in your blood sugar   It can be done  my son was  lb  oz at birth   I hope that helps a little  If it doesn t  let me know  and I will try to clarify  Gestational diabetes Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz

0	I never understood either why they re so obsessed with the fasting number  Maybe they want to know there are some times of day your blood sugar goes down  Maybe because it can be a sign of your overall blood sugar control    Well in any case  the doctors do seem to worry a lot about it  Here is the formula that usually kept mine  fasting number) under   and often under       Exercise  -  times a day  and always in later afternoon or evening  No sugar white carbs in afternoon or evening  Don t splurge on dinner-- keep the carbs down  IF you really want a treat  have it earlier in the day   Bedtime snack can be key to managing the morning fasting number  For some people a carb-protein combo works best  ex  peanut butter and crackers  cheese and crackers)  For some people ice cream even works well  For some people it has to be all protein  The best one for me was   hardboiled eggs     I found I had to do all of these things  If I skipped evening exercise or had the wrong bedtime snack  my fasting number would be above   I got really sick of eating hardboiled eggs but it worked  Jealous of the women who have GD and who have ice cream work as their bedtime snack    history of gestational diabetes  Also T  runs in the family  Long-term vegetarian  years)

0	I was just diagnoses with GMD a week and a half ago   I am   weeks pregnant   I started taking insulin at night  and am now taking insulin at night and prior to each meal   It has been a very scary past week plus   I have met with an endocronologist that specializes in GMD High risk pregnancies   I have been told I want to keep my morning fasting numbers between   -   and my   hour after meal number under     I m not quite there yet  my morning fasting number is still high  so the MD keeps adjusting my insulin   Hang in there   I completely understand how emotionally taxing this is   I ve cried more in the past week than the entire pregnancy thus far   My doctor s office has assured me that this is more common than people think   If you trust your MD  trust that they have your and your babies  best interest in mind   I know it s hard to do   Hang in there
0	Hi I m   weeks pregnant and just found out I have GD  I m in shock because my doctor and nurses told me not to worry because they thought everything was fine  But I have it  Does it hury to test your blood four times a day  I m meeting with a gd nurse and nutritionist next week  But now I m terrified that anything I eat will hurt my baby  Any suicide would be appreciated  I m a first time mom and a nervous wreck  I was also wondering if I should tell people about my GD diagnosis  I m scared they are going to think it my fault  My husband  mom  dad and sister know  but my shower is soon and I dont know if people should know  Will they blame me
1	Oh  the husband and I are HORRIBLE to the little darlings when we re stuck with  em  Oddly enough  THEY don t think so and love being with us as babysitters  We don t make all kinds of stupid rules and then don t follow through on them  But we also don t believe in the modern trying to be friends with your kids  That s for when they re on their own  THEN you can be friends with them  The husband works at a Dunkin Donuts and they can t get anyone to show up on time  Even the managers wander in late or worse  stand outside at the start of their shift smoking a cigarette and getting in the way of customers  We re going to have   basic rules when we run our business  If you make us want to use the time clock  you re fired  NC NS has   exceptions where you can come back   you were in the hospital or you were in jail   Ok    you were dead  but then it doesn t much matter ) But in very small towns the old rules still hold  That s some of why we re looking to move to one  I think a lot of it is a matter of social responsibility  Today no one is responsible for their own actions  It s always  so and so or such and such made me do X  No  you CHOSE to do X  But that s not fashionable anymore except in ranching and other communities where you still gotta do your job or you starve or get run over  A cow could care less WHY you didn t get out of her way  But in a small town  everyone also knows if you re a jerk and no one will hire you  So it behooves you to keep a decent reputation about working or you re moving  Andy

2	maryd  wrote  I understand this all too well  Anna    I ve actually had doctors tell me I don t have diabetes anymore or ask me why I say I have diabetes  The first doctor who said this  when I quiestioned her  she admitted that yes  I still had diabetes  but I think she was trying to be super encouraging  but it can be very damaging to say such things to a patient if he she doesn t know any better  not to mention that it s irresponsible and possibly unethical on the doctor s part)    I also once went in about a bladder infection and I told the nurse that I was peeing a whole lot  and she told me that s  cause I m diabetic  Don t you know that diabetics urinate a lot  she asked me  I told her diabetics with out-of-control BG  yes  She looked at me like I was a nut and didn t say anything else    It really would be nice if medical professionals who treat us knew more than we did  wouldn t it    Congrats on all your good news  btw    and good luck losing those   pounds better to tackle them now than later   cause you know they ll keep creeping on    but I ll save that for another thread) Responding to the red statements  Boy you hit the nail on the head   I guess according to the medical professional community  if we have diabetes - what ever kind - we can t get anything else - like your bladder infection  It is all too easy to assign all symptoms to diabetes  and then say it s cuz we don t manage ourselves well   I had a colleague who was dx d with type   as an adult  was a detective  He was able to keep his job as a detective because he was no longer on patrol and damn good at his job  Anyway  he got caught in crossfire with a robbery suspect  sustained a wound to his shoulder  As he should  his partner told the paramedics that my friend had diabetes   He gets to the ER  they check his bg and lo and behold it is high  So what to they do  They scold him for being out of control with his D  He said  I have been under a lot of stress recetnly - very recently  I just got shot  And by the way the bullet hole in my shoulder is not from the freaking diabetes   It is all too easy - and thus common - for doctors anda nurses to assume everything that we display symptoms for is diabetes-related  Sometimes we get other illnesses  sometims we get shot  sometimes we break a leg skiing  It would be awesome if having diabetes meant we did our quote and were indestructible by anything else  Type   -   years Avid Pumper - Would never go back to MDI CGM with Dexcom   - Loving it - Soo very accurate Along with test  test test   - x a day A C for the past   years   - hard work and an a-retentive tendency pays off Portland Oregon
0	Try not to worry  it won t change anything and will only make you miserable   The great thing in my mind about being diagnosed with GD  as opposed to diabetes at other times  is that we have extra motivation to follow the diet and exercise program  because what we do affects the little one inside of us    This is my fifth pregnancy  first one I ve had GD  I m   weeks  diagnosed with GD a few weeks ago  I test my blood sugar   times a day and watch my carbs  They say I can up to   carbs a day but I m less than that because my sugar is too high when I go as high as they say)  workout   days a week and so far so good   From what I understand for most  the diabetes goes away after the baby is born    Just remember pregnancy is such a wonderful time in life  such a privilege and women have done it forever  be thankful they found it early and you can do everything you can to keep in under control    One of the things that can actually raise your blood sugar is stress  so relax  do what they say   If you numbers go up  and they will be watching closely  they ll put you on insullin  so while that is not a good thing  the point is  you do your part  they will do theirs and most likely all will be fine      Congratulations

2	These posts want to make me cry  It is so scary to me to be in the position I am in right now  In the past I have health insurance through employers but my current employer does not offer it  I work for an insurance agency but they have managed to construct their system in such a way that all employees who work at the main headquarters get insurance and other benefits and certain employees in the field are extended these benefits but secretaries and ISR s in the field offices do not  We spend   of our time working on insurance but still  nothing  For years I have avoided medical treatment and checkups because I either could not afford it or I did not want to find something that would end up being a pre-existing condition  Finally I applied for that life insurance this past July  knowing something would probably turn up  and sure enough that rock em sock em A c did  So now I have found my way to the local community clinic which charges   per visit  I was not charged for labs such as the A c test and I got a scrip for Metformin and Benicar for   However  I did not see a doctor  I saw a nurse practitioner  which is becoming common  In August I also went back to university to finish my bachelor s degree  in hopes of finding better employment including insurance  I will graduate in December  So I think I will move to Canada  Need any good accountants up there  I am changing up all my life mainly for dependable access to health care so why not just emigrate  I harbored secret hopes that something of Obama s plans would help me but so far all I am seeing are employee s premiums and deductibles go through the roof  And yes  they are all blaming Obama  I don t know the solution  All I know is that I don t want to die of diabetes or cancer because I couldn t afford healthcare  My children are still young    and   long abandoned by their father  my ex-husband  and I am all they really have in this world  Which is why I remain so utterly grateful to have this board when I needed this support so desperately  At least I feel I can manage this diabetes for a good number of years and that gives me reasonable hope that I can parent my children to adulthood  And be there for them beyond that  But I would really like to have the security of affordable health care

0	I m not saying you need to be taking the glyburide  but that if you do take it  it should be taken every day at  say  bedtime  not whenever your numbers seem high  Staple foods for me were raw veggies  cheese  peanuts  and eggs  I took baggies of these to work as i rarely have time to actually stop and eat  Those empty carb type foods are cheaper so if you have to eat them  try to pair them with high protein and or high fat foods in order to minimize spikes  Yes  you should be testing fasting as soon as you wake up and then eating immediately after that  I usually ate within   minutes of waking up  Even if it is just a handful of nuts or a hard boiled egg  eating something will signal your body to stop with the rising blood sugar already  Exercising before eating can actually make the situation worse  Gestational diabetes Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz

1	Those are interesting articles  I have used more intense activity  sprinting) to raise my BG when I ve been on long runs and am trying to ration my supply of sugar  It works pretty reliably but I m sure my doctor would frown on it  I am not sure about the dead guy bolusing   times in two hours  That would be quite a party  I have noticed that the exercise  culprit  sugars that they seem to blame seem to be more ephemeral and go away faster and with less insulin than the kind of high BGs I get from say donuts  burritos and cheese fries
1	Sorry to hear the T  pros see it this way Lizzy  lol  I guess you ll just have to upset off when it comes to me  or not read my posts  I think Dr  Cousins and Dr  MarK Hyman s protocols are legitimate regarding reversal or control sans medication  Their regimens   diet  detox  supplementation and exercise ) are probably harder to maintain than a med regimen  but at least one would not be on meds  I am curious why the T  establishment feels either Drs  protocols are quackery  they both have endless case studies that they provide  as well as years of experience with helping T s  Mark Hyman studied under the same mentor that I did  Dr  Jim Gordon  Georgetown Univ  and Center for Mind Body Medicine  I also assisted Dr  Gordon in teaching  nd year med  students nutritional and integrated medical techniques  I m very well aware of the techniques  It s clear the your knowledge of T  is limited  Some can go med-free for years  some cannot  What might work for some  will not work for others  Whoever the T  establishment you re referring to might be is probably viewing the publicity seeking characteristics of the two  especially Hyman s misleading headlines in his Huffington Post Articles  For any of them to state that T  is curable or reversible is a crock  Let any of their case studies eat a high-carb meal and we d see how reversed it is  Just the fact that you seem to think you know more about it than people who have been living with it and dealing with it for years is telling  I just occasionally like to inject a little truth and reality into the vast illusions  There s just as much misunderstanding about T  as there is about T  Lizzy Edited to add that I see you changed you re original version after I copied the quote and began mine  Knowledge is Power  Here s some useful links  click on the titles Testing      All About Carbs Resources For The Un-insured and Discount Medicine and Equipment LizzyLou Videos Lizzy s Blog for lots more
0	Hi Stephanie  I also had gestational diabetes with my second pregnancy   yrs  ago) and am now a recently diagnosed diabetic  I have always eaten well and am fairly active too  always busy and not overweight)  but  alas  I developed diabetes anyway  What can I say  sometimes predisposition trumps whatever control we might think we have  However  being diabetic really isn t so bad  I m finding it to be very manageable and it hasn t slowed me down so far  my blood sugar is far easier to control now than it was when I was pregnant  and my diet isn t nearly as restrictive as it was then either  Long story short  having diabetes isn t an ideal situation but it isn t the end of the world  it really could be so  so much worse  Good luck with your pregnancy  Motherhood is wonderful
2	Nobody in the United States is being denied access to healthcare  Just look at our Emergency Rooms  There are signs all over stating that fact  and I truly believe there is no difference in the care received  Matter of fact  we give our indigent enough money that they don t have to work  and can spend it in Las Vegas  Hawaii  and on cruise ships   See current news headlines ) As far as the Canadian health program  why is it that people like Peter Jennings and the Labrador minister  Danny Williams  come to the U S  for treatment  Honestly  I m really not trying to be fomenting or argumentative  I like Canada  my mother was born in Saskatchewan  But you really shouldn t tout your country and healthcare too much  or you just might experience a mass exodus from the south--and then you ll be in the same boat we are  Bleeding Cubbie blue  dinycat

2	mollythed wrote  lizzylou wrote  I agree with you that Novolin insulin is less predictable and harder to manage that the newer long-lasting and rapid-acting insulins   While Rodney says he uses Novolin N  there is nothing to indicate that he is taking a Novolin mixture instead of plain Novolin N    Novolin N is NPH   It s the same thing   My package insert even calls it both   And Novolin N does act as a mixture  I know because I ve used it for over   years    Lizzy Yes  Novolin is NPH  but it is not a mixture   Novolin   is a mixture  and it contains both the NPH and Regular insulin     I know that you have a good feel for how Novolin N works   The graph I used describes it s activity as a sort of symetrical curve  but I know that some sources show it more like a bell curve skewed to the right   That is  it has a tail of activity going off to the right    The curve for Novolin R  or regular human insulin without the protamine has a similar curve  except it goes to work faster and doesn t last nearly as long    I borrowed this information in the chart below from the Merck Manual information Trisha has posted at http  community diabetes org t forums replypage board-id Adults-Living-with-Type- message-id    Onset  Peak  and Duration of Action of Human Insulin Preparations  Insulin Preparation Onset of Action Peak Action Duration of Action Regular  –  min  –  h   NPH About   h  –  h  –  h   NPH  regular  –  min Dual  NPH   R)  –  h   So what happens when you put NPH and Regular insulin together in a   mix   First  it goes to work faster than N alone  with its onset of action at  -  minutes instead of two hours   Then  somewhere between two and four hours  as the Regular insulin reaches its peak and begins to taper off  the NPH comes into its own   The result is that as the Regular is tapering off and the NPH is ascending  there is a second  sort of stair-step peak in the  -  hour range  before the insulin activity begins its final descent   It looks like the dotted line in this graph       The solid line is a mixture of NPH and rapid acting Humalog   As you might expect  the Humalog goes to work even faster than Regular insulin  and  because it has a shorter duration  it shows the stair-step double peak even more clearly )   No matter which of these insulins a person uses  it is possible to make it work if meals or snacks are timed to match peak insulin effectiveness  but they all still lack the flexibility of a basal-bolus regimen with the newer long-acting and rapid-acting insulin As I ve told people many times   It still only works that way for two meals  and carbs have to be matched to the dose of insulin  not the other way around   You could inject it three times a day  but that gets a lot trickier       My insert calls it Novolin N  NPH and    Do I have to send it to you to prove it   This confused me a great deal when I first started using it   NPH and regular is a mixture as I said    Since I fully know how it works after all of these years  I guess you re posting all of this stuff of the poster   It s not telling me anything new  Those times also depend on the individual  a YMMV thing    Lizzy Knowledge is Power  Here s some useful links  click on the titles Testing      All About Carbs Resources For The Un-insured and Discount Medicine and Equipment LizzyLou Videos Lizzy s Blog for lots more

0	Sorry  I understood your daytime numbers are fine  I just meant that if they were not  your doctor would likely be reacting the same way  So it isn t that the fasting is more important  although I had different obs with my two boys and both seemed to emphasize it more) it is that your numbers are not   in control  I had one ob that wanted me on insulin  x a day because i had three of  postprandial readings between   and   I would guess they look at fasting so much because  ) it is typically the number that goes up first and  ) it is mostly unaffected by food so it is a better indication of how resistent you are  and I don t know if I am saying that right)   Like the other poster mentioned there are certain things you can do to help but they are not always effective and they take a lot of experimentation  I found a handful of almonds at bedtime seemed to help a little but mostly my fasting fluctuated between low  s and mid  s and I have no idea why  I was taking insulin shots at night  That s good that you were tested before  Hopefully it holds off for a long long time  Good luck getting your fasting down  Gestational diabetes Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz

0	My husband decided to complain this morning that I didn t fix his tea and breakfast   I am up getting   kids off to school and another child off to daycare   He is retired and works for himself at his own pace at our home   Who should be fixing breakfast for whom   Now part of my morning is spent charting my breakfast   He wakes up at the last minute and makes all of us late   You would think after having so many kids he would get it by now  don t you    I have learned that what I thought was good eating habits during this pregnancy could have been a lot better   I had cut down on eating sweets and drinking sodas  but I was still drinking a lot of Kool aid  my favorite) and fruit juices   I am glad that I am learning to be a lot more careful   I have learned that I can follow a great GD diet and not have to eat things I don t like  there are a lot of foods I don t care for    When I asked my OB about testing at home  she told me the hospital would be doing it for me when I come once a week   I am not sure how much good home testing would do anyway because I was home testing for about a year before I came down with GD and my numbers were great   But now I am GD   I don t understand it   The hospital said my A C was      According to my OB  it might be different by the time I go to the lab next Thursday) they find out what my fasting blood sugar is and then I drink a glucose solution   We wait an hour  they draw my blood and test it again   We wait   hours and do it again   By the time all of that is over with the day is half gone or more and it is another work day lost   By Sept   th  I will have lost at least    Who knows what that amount will grow to by the end of the month   That may not seem like a lot  and I d rather lose that than my baby  but that   is a week s worth of groceries   I d rather test at home  I will be doing that anyway because my diabetic mom sent me a meter  I just have to get some strips for it) and testing at work would be no problem at all     But no one at the doctor s office is really concerned that the less money I make the less chances my family has of moving into a house that will really accomodate my family  or even buy diapers and clothes for our new boy   Why should they care   I am coming to their job   They aren t losing a thing    I guess I have been so scared and upset about this diagnosis   It is the first time I have had GD or have been considered having a high risk pregnancy   No matter what my numbers look like I am not looking forward to how I will be treated towards the end of my pregnancy and the labor and delivery   This is the first time ever I am not looking forward to those things    I am sorry I am so long winded   All of my blood relatives live hundreds of miles away  I have no one to talk to about this  and my husband has already told me I am obsessed and pregnancy and GD is all I talk about   I haven t told my Mom about this because I don t want her to worry or become even more obsessed than I am   I will probably tell her later when I am ready  because if it were one of my daughters I would like for her to tell me she was GD so I could be supportive   I really would like to thank all of you

2	Thank-you all for the comments and words of encouragement    Horseygramma - I am still testing after meals  but not every day   There is a noticable spike if I measure   hour after first bite  usually below my   post-prandial target  but not by much   By two hours after  it s usually down below the fasting target   I haven t done extensive checking at   hour after  but what I have done would indicate carbs are carbs for me  not much difference in spike patterns for different types of carb    marty  - I did manage to zest the orange without zesting my fingers    The orange sour cream cake was great   Next time I try it  I may mix it up a little with raspberry extract instead of orange   Who knew there were so many extracts    churndash and MariaFan - Club dues   Might actually be one bill that s worth paying

2	Nobody in the United States is being denied access to healthcare  Just look at our Emergency Rooms  There are signs all over stating that fact  and I truly believe there is no difference in the care received  I don t think going to the ER for regular care for diabetes is really an option  What happens when someone goes to an ER because they passed out because their blood glucose is at   or at   is that they give them some glucose in the first case  or some insulin in the second case  get them back to a normal range  and then release them  No prescription  no follow-up  until it happens again  when they repeat the same thing  They deal with the emergency and turn you loose--which is nothing like getting you a doctor  a meter  a diabetes education class and an appointment with a nutritionist  which might give you a chance to avoid the ER next time  Just for example  there are too many women who show up at the ER in labor and never saw a doctor once during the entire pregnancy  This is not what I consider reasonable access to health care  Another good example of how reliance on emergency rooms  in this case  gives us unhealthy mothers after birth  and kids who start out with a strike or two against them from thee get-go The ER is for emergencies  not regular care Elementary  my dear Watson  Morris Diagnosed Type   with an A c of   in    averaging a   A c since then with diet  exercise and Glipizide XL   meds for blood pressure and cholesterol   A bit dated  but scroll down on this page if you want to know more

1	Ha  I just replied to you in the other forum  and see you already found your way to the Type   forum     I won t repeat everything I said there  except to sayyour will find YEARS of experience here  Take some advice with a grain of salt  and as you are newly diagnosed  we will ALWAYS recommend that ANY changes be approved by your doctor   But I believe the more proactive you are  the more knowledgeable about diabetes  the more the doctor will be willing to help you get better control  which gives you more flexibility in the long run)     Its hard to offer much in the way of advice without knowing where you are now -  except  that there are   books more recommended - Think Like a Pancreas by Gary Scheiner  and Using Insulin by John Walsh  I would suggest the first title - if you decide to go on an insulin pump   then you might prefer Pumping Insulin   Pam Diagnosed Type   at age   months  over   years now Minimed pump and cgm since July   Metformin  insulin resistance)  levothyroxine thyroid)  losartan  BP) I have traveled cross country  and to Canada  UK  Kenya  Mexico  Jamaica  Equador Galapagos islands  and lived in Egypt for a year
1	Barb    Now that you know more  also post this on the T  board  I m sorry I didn t think to tell you this earlier  It may be Monday  though  before you get any response    Last year  when I had the scare  it seems that someone on this side of the boards  had been through this  and posted in my thread  I ll try to find the thread and post the link for you    You are on the thoughts and prayer list  You are strong  and you will get through this difficult time  As far as an endo  check with your Oncologist first - he or she may have a good endo in mind for you  Will you be going to Bayfront or Moffett  or right there in your town    Another thought  you may need to call Insulet  and see if chemo  radiation if you have radiation therapy  etc  will have an effect on the pod  You don t need pod troubles on top of everything else    Hang in there girl  We re all pulling for you      Hugs ))))))))))))   Trisha
0	You absolutely do not need to have a c section  I had gd with both my sons  My first was  lb  oz and my second was  lb even  No one got stuck either gestational diabetes always goes away however sometimes a woman already has type   and has simply not been diagnosed until getting pregnant  There is no way to tell the difference until you give birth  Were you given a test early on in your pregnancy  Like before   weeks  If you passed that then it will go away  You and your child are at greater risk for type two down the road but gd is genetic for the most part so you couldn t control that  Cry all you want  I cried when I got diagnosed and the later when I got put on insulin  I was scared and felt like I hat failed my child  But once you stop crying realize it is not your fault and you could not have prevented it  Then keep on top of your treatment  Control your diet  test at least four times a day and keep your numbers where they need to be  Even a few high numbers can be enough to have a negative effect on your child especially close to birth where highs can cause hypoglycemia in your child  Also keep an eye out for swelling as gd makes you more likely to have pre eclampsia  Do you know what to eat and how to test  Gestational diabetes Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz Diagnosed   weeks   u humilin-n at bedtime monkey   born    lbs  oz

2	Without naming sources  let s just say that I know someone who is going through the changes in health care from beneath the white lab coat  Patient care is now being done under an   productivity level  Sounds very efficient doesn t it  What it means is that if a family member needs to ask a question or multiple questions it must be done as billable  You ask-you pay  That level means the mounds of paperwork involved get done in the   or less time  along with lunch and break  Can you see the burnout going on and the reduction in level of care  Daily patient caseload is now through the roof  There simply isn t enough hours in the day to do all that is asked  Overtime-forget it  get all the extra work done in a standard day  figure out how to make it work  That means less time per patient lower care level  Another caregiver goes on vacation  you absorb their patients  don t forget-no overtime alowed  We must be cost effecient  Make an appointment with your PCP for a cold and try to ask about your sore foot  That presents billing coding issues so you get brushed off and told to come back and we ll look at the foot in a week  Otherwise they end up giving free treatment  ie not billable and we can t have that happening can we  Long gone are the days of simply paying for some of your doctor s time  now every question becomes a potential additional source of income  That s why all the specialists now  It s the new system and how it s done  Not good  Tom Diagnosed T  October     A c   Currently on Metformin ER  mg per day Last A c

2	I loved that part of the conversation where you asked her if she was aware there was no cure for diabetes  I am beginning to think that with online health forums like this one and others focused on diabetes more and more of us with the disease are finding the information and support we need to keep our bg and A c numbers at normal or near normal levels and that as the number of us who do so grow there will need to be a change in how to describe our growing sub-group  Currently my Endo has said if the insurance company asks why I am taking metformin and get a prescription for   test strips a month she will tell them I have no clinical evidence of diabetes because of a disciplined eating and exercise plan along with metformin and daily blood glucose checks and that I do have a damaged diabetic pancreas and would fail whatever that test is called where you drink that horrible sickly sweet liquid  Doctors and insurance companies are going to have understand that A c results  FBG results and post meal bg results in normal or near normal ranges just means we have made significant lifestyle changes that need continued ongoing support and monitoring and have nothing to do with being cured  Btw  I have had my Endo carelessly use the word cure with regard to my diabetes in the past but she has learned not to us that word in my presence or in my medical chart  Ruth T  Diagnosed Aug   with A c of   A c has been under   since Dec   Last A c   Aug   fasting   Low Carb eating   daily walks Metformin  mg twice aday

0	It looks as though you are one of those people with genes that can predispose you to diabetes  Your gestational diabetes was just the first indication that your body is not working completely normally when it comes to handling carbs    Yes  exercise  and losing weight will probably help keep blood glucose down  Even more important though is to learn how many carbs your body can tolerate and adjust what you eat to possibly get back to the normal range  but definitely not creep up past the prediabetes range  into a diagnosis of diabetes    The advantage you have over others with prediabetes is that you have a head start understanding carbs and meters  A doctor will not usually prescribe a meter for a person who has prediabetes  but you can do some testing before and after meals  even if you have to pay for your own test strips and that can be immensely valuable in keeping track of how you body is responding to what you eat    Come on over to the Adults Living with Type   forum  tell your story about having had gestational diabetes  and get some advice about how to deal with your current situation with prediabetes  I m sorry you have to join us  but believe it or not  you are so lucky to catch it early  Molly  aka mollythed) Type   diabetes diagnosed in   now managed with Lantus  Humalog and Metformin  diet and exercise  My husband and three adult sons also have type   diabetes

2	nonoodles      You are right about the recent legislation aimed at prohibiting animal manures from being used as fertilizer for commercially sold produce      And this legislation comes straight from the same folks who approved Avandia for sale on the open market even though it was known for increasing one s chance of having heart attacks      This legislation comes straight from the same folks who approve aspartame  aka Equal) artificial sweetener for sale to the general public  even though it is known for causing really bad headaches  which is what the stuff did to me before I finally quit drinking sodas with aspartame in them)  and now the latest research is even finding aspartame can cause cancer      This legislation comes straight from the same folks who -- until just a few years ago -- approved mercury  a very toxic heavy metal) in the vaccinations that we were giving our small children        And I could go on and on and on with this list  but I think you get my point    The folks passing those laws do NOT have a very good track record at determining what should -- and should not -- be allowed to be sold on the open market      If animal manures -- when applied properly -- were TRULY dangerous to food crops  then you probably would not be alive right now    And I probably would not be either      You see  all the way up until about the end of World War   that WAS the fertilizer that almost all people used to grow the food sold in the marketplace      Animal manures are ONLY dangerous when they are applied to the garden when they are fresh  and even then only to plants that touch the ground     In other words  they would be dangerous to lettuce or cabbage because they are so low growing to the ground  but would not be dangerous for a tomato that was grown four feet above the ground in a stout tomato cage)      I age all manures at least three months before they go into my garden  five months  for plants like lettuce or cabbage  which tend to touch the soil as they are growing)      Not only do I eat raw foods right out of my garden  but a whole lot of other people do too -- including the head extension agent for the local office of the University of Tennessee Extension Service      I also win alot of first place ribbons  and even an occasional purple Best of Show rosette) for my organically grown produce -- fertilized with my chicken s manure      We re all healthy and doing just fine  thank you      Which is more than I can say for most of the ding-bats who voted for that legislation    How many of them suffer from hypertension  or ulcers  or whatever      The reason such legislation passes is because nowadays  most people have no experience growing food themselves    They have never done it  and they don t know anybody who does    Or if they have done it  they were duped by the commercial agricultural chemical industry into thinking that the only way to grow food is to dump lots of chemical on the plants      Either way  they legislate on something that they do not have a clue about     And power in the hands of a Clueless Person can be a dangerous thing      It is going to make it all the more difficult for folks who do not grow some of their own food to find TRUE  HIGH QUALITY organic food for sale    Because almost all of the TRUE  HIGH QUALITY organic food is grown by small  local growers who do NOT even try to get USDA Organic Certification  it s literally too expensive -- about   a year -- which is too high for somebody who only makes about a   selling their extra produce)      I guarantee you -- the stuff I grow is much higher quality than what you find in the store  tastes better  is more nutrient dense than what you buy in a store  which I prove in my classes using a scientific instrument called a refractometer) -- and it is fertilized mostly with AGED chicken manure       And no  I don t bother to try and get USDA Organic Certification for my produce  because it costs about   a year for a farm to get that certification  and in my best years  I don t sell a thousand bux worth of my excess garden food    It s just not worth the trouble

0	Since you have a family history of type   diabetes  it will be really important for you to start working on your diet  i am assuming you are right now  ) during your pregnancy and even after your pregnancy    It is true for some women the gestational diabetes will go away after pregnancy  but it is also true that you are now  at a higher risk of developing type      the best thing you can do for your baby and yourself is to work with a dietician or health coach on a weekly basis so they can take a really good look at what you are eating and help guide you to making better food choices    One of the biggest problems that people are not aware of is High Fructose Corn Syrup it is in many packaged foods  sauces  salad dressings   Start looking at labels and if you see anything that says Corn Syrup  HFCS stay away from it even if it says organic     Donna

0	I took my   hour glucose test last week  My fasting number was   My first hour after the drink was   My second hour number was   My final number was   The nurse or lab tech that called said I officially passed  She said my first hour number was too high and my second number was borderline  She said   is the cut off but everything I ve read online says   is the cut off  She is having me come in to meet with my doctor January   and they are putting me on a GD diet  but according to her  I won t be checking my levels YET  I m not sure if my doctor will say something different when I get there or what  but do you think with those levels  I should ask about getting a meter to check my levels  This is my second pregnancy  I m   years old  I m  --almost   weeks  I did not have any issues with this during my first pregnancy  I did take the test the day after Christmas  after eating badly for   days if that makes a difference  but I did the fasting test  so I don t know if that matters  Any advice  Thanks
1	ndali  ) Ugh  I hate it  I started a new sensor on Friday morning  and all day had the same issues I had in the last   sensors  They work for a few hours  then time out and then I have to recalibrate  which makes it not work for about   hours  Then at my softball game I got a sensor error  that happened all evening  So I ripped it out and haven t turned back  More annoyance than it is worth  frankly  Super upset about it  but I d rather just test  I m trying to get my insurance to pay for a Dexcom plus  so please tell me that s not the CGM that made you so frustrated

1	Well  it s not like I didn t expect it   After   yrs w  this disease  I m fully aware I ve no right to complain  I should ve been dead three times already   BUT  something that could be of value to some of you  is the way this went down   Over the past few years  I ve found myself out of breath when active  coaching soccer  refereeing soccer   In the past few months  even hauling a load of laundry up downstairs left me winded sometimes   I ve had half-a-dozen heart stress tests  and passed all of them with flying colours   A few  maybe   or   ) weeks ago  I had a severe bout of winded PLUS chest pains  radiating into my neck and upper arms   A trip to the ER  and they told me I had esophageal reflux   indigestion)  but a visit to a cardiologist  and they suggested another stress test   Another you re fine  you re heart s as strong as an ox  BUT  it turns out  T s typically suffer from a condition known as Balanced Abnormal arteriosclerosis   In summary  this means that the blockages that form in the arterial walls are balanced   In short  the stress tests that the heart doctors perform are based upon a comparison of the left and right side flows of the heart  if they are significantly different  a problem is presumed  and a catheterization is performed to measure the blockages   But diabetics are known to have a tendency to have blockages of equal size on both sides  balanced abnormalities)  resulting in equal or similar flows  in my case  the subsequent catheterization  recommended by my cardiologist) showed blockages of   on the left  and   on the right   So    wks ago today at noon  I had quadruple coronary bypass graft surgery   They sawed my sternum in half from the top to the bottom  pried open my chest with crowbars  reconnected my heart s arteries and veins to a heart lung machine  re-plumbed my heart with veins and arteries from my chest and legs  and reassembled it all back where it came from and stitched it all up   Today  two weeks later  I can walk half a mile at a time  have no chest pain other than the pain associated with the carving itself  and am looking forward to my granddaughter s HS graduation  realistically   I ve spent my life showing The Bastards  medical experts) they re wrong about what we can do  last week  and the next   at least  I m showing them that they re wrong about how long it takes to recover from this  today  the nurse practitioner I was assigned for   months signed off that I no longer need that service  in another week  I go for rehab  and I intend to outperform anything they expect for someone who s COMPLETED their program   I ll keep y all posted  and by the way  while the hospital experience was overall good  I came out alive ) there were some issues associated with how they manage T  diabetes  but that s another post   Good luck to all who have this experience  and I hope this gives some insight to what to expect if you re facing this problem    w  Wayne T  May   MDI   u Lantus Basal

1	trisha   ) Mary  said  You realize that the CGMS is supposed to track patterns in your sugars not the sugars themselves  right  Mary  Just wondering if you use a cgm  I don t know about the other cgm systems  but essentially  they all do the same thing  Besides being able to see trends  it does show what the glucose is  within the interstital fluid  My Navigator shows every minute what my glucose is  The Navigator also has a port for finger pokes - for calibrations  and for regular finger pokes  Trisha - edited for lack of a comma I use the MM   silhouette senserter for my cgms paradigm series  It does help me see the trends and things I ve never seen before the sensors were approved  but now that I have them they are a little tricky  but its better than what I had before  My paradigm shows me in   minute intervals what my intersistial fluid is doing  but the fingerstick is the best form of truly knowing what a glucose level is right then and there  So I go nowhere w o my glucose meter  I ve also noticed how even if I use something like Splenda in a mug of morning  joe  how my sugars are affected by the teeny amount of carb in the sucralose    I try to limit my consumption of diet soda and other baked goods withartificial sweeteners  since a study in the JAMA in the Mar  issue of Diabetes Self Management has found that diet sodas can cause weight gain around a persons belly and a condition known as  metabolic syndrome  where the body has to deal with increased girth and high b p  and triglycerides as a result of overeating carbs because the diet soda made their appetite more pronounced and they consumed more calories than if they had chosen a plain ol glass of H O to satisfy their thirst  i know that I used to down     liter bottles of diet soda as a teen and thought i was doing my body some good oh well  Anyway way off the subject  I do use a cgms and love it because my blood sugars are becoming more stablethe longer i use the thing  Hope you are having a good time  and hope to hear from you  Stay cool my peeps

2	Good grief  I don t know how this thread got to this     It s all because YOU confessed to being a Cubs fan  There appears to be an enormous amount of confusion about the new health care bill  and there appears to be a lot of deliberate misinformation being dissseminated  Here is one small example of that  As you may know  the health care reform bill requires that by   all companies over a certain size  I think it is   employees) must provide health insurance for their employees or face a fine  of   per employee per year) that will be used to subsidize insurance for those who cannot afford it  To implement this they have required that companies list the value of the health premiums paid as an information item on W  forms  So yesterday someone here forwarded me an email froml a senior tax advisor for Kiplinger a respected firm  which quoted that part of the legislation and then went on to claim  that Starting in    next year folks)  your W-  tax form sent by your employer will be increased to show the value of whatever health insurance you are given by the company  Now  your insurance will be INCOME on your W s  You will be required to pay taxes on a large sum of money that you have never seen  For many  it also puts you into a new higher bracket so it s even worse  In other words this email is spreading a total misrepresentation and deliberately lieing about this aspect of health care reform in order to scare people  While the amount will be listed  it will NOT be added into taxable income  nor will it push anyone into a higher bracket  It will be listed so that companies that do not provide insurance can be asked to do so or to pay the fine for not doing so  Why do people who know the truth spread lies about it  usually because in some way they or their clients want to change things for their own benefit  or to avoid changes that might cost them  Instead of saying that  they obscure their motives by making up facts  Can there be any wonder why this is all so confusing  Morris Diagnosed Type   with an A c of   in    averaging a   A c since then with diet  exercise and Glipizide XL   meds for blood pressure and cholesterol   A bit dated  but scroll down on this page if you want to know more

1	Hi Acid  Congrats on your finish  I read elsewhere that the IV  doesn t stick well enough to hold the sensor on for more than light activity  The recommendation was to use a tape called Hypafix  which apparently sticks a lot better  My current sensor was totally unreliable for about the first   days and I was ready to ditch it  but for some inexplicable reason seems to have settled down  I suspect it has a lot to do with the actual insertion sites  It woke me up last night with a Hi Bg alarm  I was convinced that it was playing up  but when I tested  it was right  I took a correction  which did naff-all)  so I put in a new infusion set at   am  took another correction  and was close to target this morning  Having to time the insertions is a major PITA  If I do it in the morning  my Bg s aren t particularly stable after breakfast  whereas if I do it at bedtime  I have to do a  nd calibration within   hours
0	This is long  please excuse me  I am approaching my late  s and I took the   hour glucose test yesterday  My fasting blood sugar was perfect  but my other three reading showed that my body was not processing glucose as fast as it should  st reading after an hour was   next one   hours later was   and I don t know what the third one was)  I don t understand how I had such a perfect fasting score   out of a range of   to  ) and then everything go so wrong with the other scores to the point that I now have to have all the baggage of gestational diabetes  I go see my OBGYN today to discuss what course of action we should take  This will be the first time she and I have talked after the crappy glucose results  I have no idea what is going to happen  I am afraid I will be required to have so many doctor s appointments that I will hardly be able to work  I don t have the kind of job where I can come in late or leave early)  I know the health of myself and the child comes first  but I also have to consider the family that I already have  Plus  we desperately need to move into a bigger home before the baby is born  As of now  we would literally have no where to put him in the house we currently live in  I also feel so cheated because this was the pregnancy that I tried to do things right  The only time I have eaten cookies or ice cream was in July  I actually tried to drink the required amount of water per day  and exceed it  I rarely eat candy  and I have spent a fortune on vegetables and fruits  I ate mostly vegetables because we grew some)  Well so much for all of that  I m doing worse now than what I was when I ate honey buns and lasagna during a few previous pregnancies  I also fear that the rest of my pregnancy  labor and delivery will just be one big parade of medical interventions and medical requirements that will interrupt my life  I am afraid that they will use GD as an excuse to make my son s birth look more like a surgery to remove a cancerous tumor than a birth  I try to labor as naturally as possible  and if a lot of medical intervention and a c-section is the route that must be taken  as the last resort  then fine  I don t want to just be shoved down the medical intervention surgery road without trying to avoid it first  Please don t give me the you have to do whatever necessary to have a healthy baby routine  trite answer  I have had   miscarriages in a row    in all  I already know that as well or better than most people  Did anyone else feel this way  Do you feel you had a positive outcome

1	One nice thing about the Dex is you don�t have to worry about what your BS is doing or when you ate to calibrate  The Navigator was easier than the Minimed but if it was moving too fast  it wouldn�t calibrate  I can�t say I would be too happy if it bleeped at me and I was   At least when I was bleeped at  I was really low  But it bleeped a lot at night the first   weeks - I was ready to start bleeping back  I am sure it was probably someone that didn�t run that decided races should be at the crack of dawn  I always thought it was more just me but I guess not  I entered a  k once and my cousin tried to talk me out of it because it was all hills  We ran the course a couple days before so I know I was able to do all the hills but when I tired in the morning  it didn�t take long to fizzle out  Kelly www kellywpa wordpress com Type   Diagnosed January    Dexcom Seven Plus CGMS Pumping With Animas PIng   Apidra Since June
1	Thanks for the tips and congratulations and all that  I am  not  planning on running a full marathon anytime soon  My aunt and cousin had suggested SFO in July  and I was doing long enough runs over the winter that I could project that it would be possible but the whole notion of surrendering myself to the sort of training schedule  where you re sort of locked into I have to do   miles   nights this week and then   this weekend doesn t appeal to me right now  I won t say  never  but I like running   marathons distance-wise and I can see that I can probably get ready for one in about a month if I maintain a certain level of activity  We got a gym so I m doing that every other night and that s fun as a diversion too  Re the CGM  I totally agree about the  every sensor being different  business  I think that pretty much every brand has similar issues w  reliability  sensors failing  like one did this AM ) and all that  I m not sure about the bleeping bleeping though  I agree that my low alert is set too high if it s set just at the lower edge of where my goal in my head is  I will play around w  it more now too that I don t have to worry about screwing up training runs  races for a while  hee hee
1	Acid and the other poster  forgot your name  that have just started on the Minimed system  I agree with Kelly that you should think really hard about whether or not to keep the CGM because once you go past that   days you are stuck with it  Your insurance won t just approve another system  I am absolutely loving the Dex for Melissa  In two weeks I have only heard it beep maybe   times  It doesn t alarm to make you do calibrations either and you never lose readings if you don t do one  Of course your readings may go off a bit  but that is all  It vibrates first and then alarms if you don t press a button  You can set the reminder alarms where you want them so that it is not constantly telling you that you are high or low while you are waiting to bring a bg up or down  The insertion needle is small and we have not seen one drop of blood  You can restart a sensor without removing the transmitter  You don t have to tape over it at all but I did use some Skin Tac and some Flexfix tape over the   days she wore the last one  She takes HOT showers  I suspect that there are many Minimed systems sitting in people s drawers unused because they are too damned much hard work  I would do without a system before I put all of that energy into one  These things are supposed to help make things easier  not complicate your lives  Off my soapbox now  And I will add though that I know that for some people that don t want to have to carry another item  that it is the only one to consider  I hope that the Animas and Omnipod integration with Dex comes soon  I think that Minimed will be in trouble when that happens although many people still think that the biggest is the best and most trusting of them  If Abbott gets their stuff together I think that their only chance will be to integrate with a pump  because they won t have many people left using their product now  Mary  mom to Michael and Melissa  both Type   Michael is an adult  living on his own and using a CGM and MDI Melissa is also an adult  with an intellectual disability  therefore she needs lots of help managing her diabetes  She uses an Omnipod pump and Dexcom CGM
0	I live overseas in a relatively remote location in Asia  but I have minimal Western medical via my husband s employer  affiliated with the US embassy)   I was not planning to leave my overseas location before I am required by these circumstances at   weeks to go to the US for the   weeks prior to due date delivery   I am at   weeks in my second pregnancy  so far no problems  have been checking in with our local medical provider every   weeks   Was planning to go to her this week  late in week  ) at her recommendation for the glucose tolerance test   This medical provider has now been recalled to the US for an indefinite period and there may not be a replacement immediately   There are not reliable medical options locally that I trust any more than this provider   Already in looking into the GTT in more depth  I see that I may doubt my provider s advice to be testing before week    But beyond this  I wonder whether there is an approach for me to take as an alternative to taking the test   E g  to trust in glucose levels detected so far in future in regular urine tests  to watch for other signs such as baby s growth  to be very mindful of diet  already do eat very healthy  but could cut out some things)   Or am I more advised to fly out to take the test at a different location with more services just to be sure   I can see that having GD undetected and untreated would be a bad thing for my baby  although apparently not life threatening  And it sounds like not harmful at all or with very minimal risk to me  I am   but not overweight  gaining moderately to low in the advised weight gain range for my height and pre-PG weight  have no family history of diabetes  had no GD with my first child  am not in the genetic ethnic groups that are listed as higher risk for GD  Thank you for any advice others on this list can give

2	Dianne has told you about British Columbia s health plan  I can tell you about Alberta  Canada s plan   B C  and Alberta are provinces in Canada  provinces are the equivalent of states in the US)  Each province in Canada has its own health plan  though the federal government has mandated that there must be universal health care coverage in every province  In Alberta  the government health plan is called Alberta Health Care  It is free to everyone who lives in Alberta  whether citizen or legal immigrant  I am in the latter group  a US citizen who currently resides in Calgary  Alberta as do more than   other Americans  most in in oil industry)  Alberta Health Care coverage means free visits to the physician of one s choice  free hospital stays  free medical tests  free emergency room visits  free MRIs  free stress test  free CT scans  etc  The hospital stay is in a shared room  If you want a private room you must pay   a day  unless they decide you need to be in a private room  then it is free  Prescriptions taken at home are not covered by AHC  Medications required while in hospital are covered  Working people usually get this coverage as an employment benefit  Seniors get coverage through Alberta Blue Cross paid by the provincial government  I am a senior  Prescription costs are covered   but the maximum copay is   for a  -month prescription supply  Prescriptions  eyeglasses and dental are completely covered for people of low income  For me  I buy extra coverage for dental and eyeglasses  I get it through Blue Cross  The premiums vary by age and by how much coverage one wants  We get the most comprehensive package and pay   per month  which covers both my husband and myself  There are other insurers available but we are very happy with Alberta Blue Cross  I also buy travel insurance through them  When my husband was still working  his plan at work covered the travel insurance as well as dental and eyeglasses  Like Dianne  we have easy access to our physicians  opthalmologists  specialists of all kinds  CDEs and RD CDEs  I get an A C and minerals check done every   months  by standing order at the lab)  and yearly get my lipids  creatinine  kidneys  etc  tests done at no charge  I just show my health care card  Once my son  when younger  was on a school bicycle trek in the mountains  He fell off his bike and got hurt  He was taken to a local hospital in another city  He did not have his health care card with him  They treated him and gave him a postcard to fill out and send back with his health care number on it  Honor system  The statistics show that people live longer in Canada than in the US and that infant mortality rates are lower in Canada  As an American  I have seen both systems at work  and I really love the Canadian system  I would be happy to answer anyone s questions about it  Yes  taxes are higher in Canada  by a few percentage points  But when one factors in the enormous amount American pay for health care  it really is cheaper to live in Canada

0	I understand your setting in reality  but the reality is you don t have to have diabetes because a family member has it you don t have to have it later on in life just because you were diagnoised with gestational diabetes this is not to say to live in denial but step up and eat well and stay active  I don t want others who are in my situation believe that they have to have type   diabetes later down the road just because oh it s in their life plan  I am very active  and eat healthy  I hope to be an inspiration to those who are pre-diabetic or have gestational diabetes to let them know not to give up and keep a healthy lifestyle with a healthy attitude and they don t have to suffer with living with diabetes  Also  for those who have type   diabetes there is much you can do and hope to living a much healthier lifestyle it takes time and effort but you can do it

2	Happy Hen--   Can you give us a link to the   study comparing nutrients in   and    produce    While I certainly would not dispute the idea that modern agricultural methods have resulted in the depletion of soil nutrients  and thus affected the nutrient quality of the foods we eat  I think to a certain extent nutrient deficiencies in American bodies are caused even more by the substitution of factory produced foods than by the declining content of the good foods  grown by farmers  that we eat  And I certainly have read that the nutrients that you can get in pill forms are much harder for the human body to absorb than the nutrients that you get from the foods you eat    Which is to say that a nutrient deficiency comes more from eating fast foods  packaged foods and the like than anything else  and that people with diabetes who are choosing to eat a balanced diet with plenty of vegetables and fruits are probably doing a whole lot better in terms of getting those nutrients than people eating what has become the Standard American Diet  To the point where I was advised by my doctor that because of the way I eat  taking a multi-vitamin was not likely to help me   I cut back to every other day in response )   A personal case in point was trying to supplement magnesium  calcium  potassium  Vitamin E in turn to ameliorate my nightly leg cramps  and then concluding it must be my statin drug--curtailing that proved to have no effect whatsoever  But when I went hiking with a retired doctor  he pointed out that such cramps are the result of deficiencies  and the only thing I hadn t tried getting more of was sodium   Although the Standard American Diet has way too much sodium    of that comes from processed foods  I was not eating any and it turned out that I was not getting enough sodium--and adding it back in has done wonders for my poor calves    A more general case in point would be chromium   An Asian study showed that supplementation with chromium reduced blood sugar levels  Further studies elsewhere said they did not  A common interpretation of those conflicting results was that the soil in India  where the first study was conducted was low in chromium  bu that was not the case where the subsequent studies were done    In other words  IF you were deficient in chromium  supplementation could help  If not  then the supplementation made no difference at all  Kind of like the millions and more spent of super doses of some nutrients that cannot be absorbed by the body beyond a certain point    So my guess would be  Max  that if in fact you are deficient in magnesium  getting more of it would be a good idea  But just saying that a lot of people are deficient  and therefore I should take a supplement  is jumping to a conclusion  unless you can verify first that in fact you are one of those people  Morris Diagnosed Type   with an A c of   in    averaging a   A c since then with diet  exercise and Glipizide XL   meds for blood pressure and cholesterol   A bit dated  but scroll down on this page if you want to know more

2	Opponents of health care reform are always quick to say that Canadians come to the US for our superior medical care  but somehow forget the thousands of Americans who fly to India and other countries for routine operations that they either cannot get or cannot afford here at home  And the Canadians who post on this message board express great satisfaction with what they have and would not trade their medical care for what we have to put up with  I don t have a dog in this fight but here are some facts about the British Columbia Medical Services plan  My husband and I pay a total of   per month for coverage which equals and often excels the coverage I read about on the board  We can chose our own doctor and nobody has ever asked for a photograph  Appointments are easy to get with our family doctor and referrals to specialists have never taken more than a few days to a couple of weeks  I have email access to my CDE and Registered Dietician  who is also a CDE) and can make an appointment with them within a week  I also have a monthly Diabetes Health Session I can attend with both the CDE s an a doctor or Registered Nurse Practitioner there  No paperwork is necessary for the above appointments and there is no charge  Nor is there a charge for visits to Urgent Care or the ER  That is the up side but there are some flaws  This plan does not cover dental and vision care except when referred by a doctor  I do get to see an opthamologist under the plan because I have diabetes and I think that any type of dental surgery is covered  Many people enroll in private plans to cover dental and things like chiropractors  We haven t bothered but may regret it as our teeth get older  Drugs are not covered by the Medical Services Plan but there is an income based plan that assists those of us with modest means  You are probably all aware that drugs cost less here because we don t have the big mark up that some other countries have   Our research funds come from other sources) The Canadians you hear about going to the US for care are usually going for optional surgery  hip and knee replacements  There is a waiting period for that and it is true that you can be bumped down the list if someone falls and needs an immediate hip replacement  Those with enough money will seek the surgery elsewhere rather than wait  just as a lot of Americans go abroad for what they consider better and less expensive treatment  We have a shortage of doctors in some areas so sometimes people have to wait to get attached to a regular family doctor  It usually isn t long and it does not take long to choose a new doc if the one you have is not a good fit  Keep in mind that this is not socialized medicine such as found in the UK and some other European countries  Canada has Universal Health Care and many decades ago we went through all the problems that you are dealing with  It wasn t pretty but now we are on the whole very happy that this is the system we have  Those of us who have lived in the US  with green cards) found that system to be lacking  One thing I would like to add is that we do not do medicine for profit  Thus our costs are way lower and we are able to deliver care that keeps us a little higher on the list of ratings for health care in the world  And our life span is a smidge longer that that in the US  So we think that this single payer plan is working  I wish you all well in this transition time and I hope that the years to come will allow you all to have fair  reasonable coverage that helps relieve some of the anxiety that health problems bring to most of us  Dianne Dianne Diagnosed as type   in   with an A c of   Started with metformin and a low dose of an ARB for blood pressure  Added a sulfonylurea  a med that helps my pancreas produce my own insulin) Also a low dose of Crestor to lower my cholesterol  After   years I could no longer tolerate metformin so am doing my best to keep control with a max dose of the sulfonylurea and lots of walking  some swimming
